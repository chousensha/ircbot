You there, check out that noise!
We're under attack! A vast, ye swabs! Repel the invaders!
You landlubbers are tougher than i thought. I'll have to improvise!
D'ah! Now you're making me angry!
None may challenge the Brotherhood!
Lapdogs, all of you!
Fools! Our cause is righteous!
The Brotherhood shall prevail!
And stay down!
Anyone want to take a break? Well too bad! Get to work you oafs!
Get those parts moving down to the ship!
The cannons must be finished soon.
VanCleef pay big for your heads!
Foe Reaper 5000 on-line. All systems nominal.
Overdrive engine activated.
Acquiring target...
Target acquired. Harvesting servos engaged.
Safety restrictions off-line. Catastrophic system failure imminent.
Overheat threshold exceeded. System failure. Wheat clog in port two. Shutting down.
The mistress will pay me handsomely for your heads!
Bombs away!
No...NO!
OAF SMASH!!
Ready Oafie? Throw!
I didn't need him! Not when I've got YOU oafs!
The scales... have... tipped...
Ah, fresh meat!
Do you feel that chill running up your spine?
The fog is rolling in...
I can smell your fear...
I will rip your heart from your chest!
Your blood only increases my hunger!
You will... NOT find her... until it is too late...
Glubtok show you da power of de arcane!
Fists of flame!
Fists of frost!
Glubtok ready?
Let's do it!
ARCANE POWER!!! 
TOO...MUCH...POWER!!!
I've been waiting a long time for this, you know.
Biding my time, building my forces, studying the minds of my enemies.
I was never very good at hand-to-hand combat, you know. Not like my father.
But I always excelled at poisons.
Especially venoms that affect the mind.
Poor Glubtok. When his powers manifested, his own ogre mound was the first to burn.
Deep within his soul, the one thing he feared most of all was...himself.
Most rogues prefer to cloak themselves in the shadows, but not Helix.
You never know what skitters in the darkness.
Can you imagine the life of a machine?
A simple spark can mean the difference between life...and death.
Ripsnarl wasn't always a bloodthirsty savage. Once, he even had a family.
He was called James Harrington. A tragedy in three parts.
James...please...I love you...
Calissa...I am so sorry...
I will not share my father's fate! Your tale ends here!
Fools! This entire ship is rigged with explosives! Enjoy your fiery deaths!
If I'm going to die, I'm taking you with me!
ENOUGH! I will not give you the pleasure.
MY FATE IS MY OWN!
Leave this accursed place at once!
This death is only a temporary respite from my curse.
Who dares interfere with the Sons of Arugal?
You, too, shall serve!
Another falls!
Release your rage!
Intruders in the keep! To arms!
Our vigilance is eternal...
A few weeks in this pathetic castle will give us time to work on some new products and let others forget about the unfortunate... misunderstanding in Dragonblight.
Did they bother to tell you who I am and why I am doing this?...or are they just using you like they do everybody else?But what does it matter. It is time for this to end.
Baxter! Get in there and help! NOW!
It is time, Frye! Attack!
...please don't think less of me.
I can't believe it! You've destroyed my pack... Now face my wrath!
Ivar's pack failed horribly, so now he sends mercenaries. No matter, your journey ends in agony.
That bitch Sylvanas sent you too, did she? No matter, your journey ends in agony.
I thank you for the clean death. I would not of done the same...
If I had my way, you would be long dead. Your kind disgusts me.
I'm trying to convince Godfrey to just kill all of you to end your misery, but he keeps telling me no. More pain and suffering for the lot of you, then!
Tally ho! The hunt begins!
This is just too easy...
HA! Let's at least keep it interesting.
Killed by lowly commoners, how droll...
Even here i find myself beset by fools!
My new life was just beginning...
I am the serpent king, I can do anything.
None can stand against the serpent lords!
You will never wake the dreamer!
The coils of death... Will crush you.
Who dares disturb my meditation?!
Sleep...
Dust to dust.
You should not be here! Slay them!
Tell the warden this prison is ours now!
More of the warden's errand boys!
Aah, fresh meat!
ALL MUST BURN!
FIRE... EXTINGUISHED!
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Randolph Moloch, and I will be killing you all today.
My epic schemes, my great plans! Gone
Forest just setback!
Yiiipe!
USURPERS!!! GNOMEREGAN IS MINE!!!
My machines are the future! They'll destroy you all!
Explosions! MORE explosions! I've got to have more explosions!
...and stay dead! He got served!
Electric justice!
We hunger for vengeance.
No rest, for the angry dead.
More... More souls.
Tell me... tell me everything!
Naughty secrets!
ORah laz lok belaros ante rikk modas
I'll rip the secrets from your flesh!
Purged by pain!
It is over, your search is done. Let fate choose now, the righteous one.
Get over here, you idiot!
Here's my body, fit and pure! Now, your blackened souls I'll cure!
Harken, cur! Tis you I spurn! Now feel... the burn!
Soldiers arise, stand and fight! Bring victory at last to this fallen knight!
This end have I reached before. What new adventure lies in store?
Your body lies beaten, battered and broken. Let my curse be your own, fate has spoken.
You will not defile these mysteries!
Burn in righteous fire!
Release the hounds!
Ah, I've been waiting for a real challenge.
Light, give me strength!
Blades of Light!
Ha, is that all?
Infidels. They must be purified!
At your side, milady.
Unworthy.
Mograine has fallen? You shall pay for this treachery!
The light has spoken!
Arise, my champion!
For Victory! For Agamaggan!
Troublesome whelps. I'll teach you to interfere!
You outsiders will pay for encroaching on our land!
Bah! My power rules here!
Our new allies will avenge us!
You wish to learn of the stone? Follow me.
For so long I have drifted in my cursed form. You have freed me... Your hard work shall be repaid.
Mine! Mine! Mine! Gizlock is the ruler of this domain! You shall never reveal my presence!
None may steal the secrets of the makers.
Who dares awaken Archaedas? Who dares the wrath of the makers!
Awake ye servants, defend the discs!
To my side, brothers. For the makers!
Reckless mortal.
By Thaurissans Beard! Slay them!
Me Grimlok, KING!
You da man now, dog!
Who dares disrupt the sanctity of Eldre'Thalas? Face me, cowards!
You do not belong here! Ancients, rise up against these intruders!
Help me crush these punys!
Hey, who Fengus callin' a gnoll lover?! Take da prisoners to da king; you smart to bring them with their weapons and show da king that they a threat. I'll go see if Fengus talk smack when I give him da beatdown! HAR!
OK Fengus, where you at?! You come call me a gnoll lover while I give you da hammer upside da head!
Do you want to play a game, stinky?
If you want the key, you'll have to catch me!
I hold the key to lands of free! Catch me and you'll see!
Chase me if you dare! I run without a care!
Still alive? You do surprise. Watch me as I flee!
Why would you ever want to harm me!? Come. Friends we can be!
Turn that frown upside down!
Die?! You make Pusillin cry!
This is the end of the line, no friend of mine!
Say hello to my little friends!
You no challenge me, scrubs! I'm da king now and I stay king FOREVER!!!
You da boss now, yeah? Long live da new king!
Kreeg let you look at Gordok hooch. Ogre hooch best of all hooch, and Gordok hooch best of all ogre hooch! Maybe you buy some from me, ya boss?!
What, may I ask, are you doing here? Put on your student's attire, and study!
Have you come from the Burning Steppes? Do you have my black dragon eggs?
We await a batch of black dragon eggs from the Burning Steppes. We believe that, through their study, we will advance our knowledge dramatically.
The Lich King's forces are building. It is imperative that our timetable supports his plans.
Be silent! Do you think our plagued dragons will hatch and train themselves?
Now, if you turn to page 34 of your text, you see an illustration of a dwarf under going dissection...
Take note of the plagued dragon's diet. Only terrified flesh will suffice.
From yesterday's field trip, Marduk showed us that the dragons will tolerate the meat of recently killed humanoids, but only if they died slowly and painfully.
What is this?! How dare you!
Tomorrow we will begin training of our promising dragons, so don't forget your chew toys.
The doctor is in!
Your future is clouded. Concentrate, and ask again.
You don't look like a student...
Your mind is unfocused. Are you hiding something from me?
I sense a disturbance, lurking around you...
School is in session!
Me smell stench of the living!
Thank you for becoming my next victim!
We will spread across this barren land!
We will enslave the quilboar!
Soon, the Scourge will rule the world!
Slay them, my brethren! For the Scourge!
You'll never leave this place alive.
I am the hand of the Lich King!
To me, my servants!
Come, spirits - attend your master!
Too... Easy.
Let the executions begin.
Justice is done.
How dare you enter my sanctum!
T'eif godehsi wha!
This desert be mine!
The Sandfury reign supreme!
Feel the fury of the sands!
Lunch has arrived my beautiful children. Tear them to pieces!
Rise and defend your master!
The children of Sul will protect their master. Rise once more Sul'ithuz!
Ahh, a new chew toy for my dogs!
Come to aid the Throne!
Hail to the king, baby!
You will not harm Emperor Thaurissan!
I'm going to kick yer ugly head in!
You want a fight? A fight you'll get!
I crush weaklings like you every day! Bring it on!
You know not what you do! We must destroy you for your own good!
Turn back! Do not wake the dreamer!
The shield be down! Rise up Atal'ai! Rise up!
The Soulflayer comes!
Join us!
Hakkar shall live again!
I'll crush you!
Me smash! You die!

Haaa ha ha haa! Now, heathens... face da TRUE might of Bethekk!
It did not have to end dis way!
This body is useless!
Meddlesome insects! Now you will feel my wrath!
Welcome to de great show, friends. Just wait 'til ya see what I got in store for ya.
No one gonna stop Jin'do!

Now, have a taste of Jin'do's true powah!

Your sssacrifice pleases him.

Hisss word, FILLS me, MY BLOOD IS VENOM, AND YOU WILL BATHE IN THE GLORY OF THE SNAKE GOD!

Don't worry. Zanzil won't leave ya dead for long...
How does dat taste?
Oooh, pretty... Zanzil's got big plans for dis one.
Hahahaha!
Breathe deep, friends! Breathe it all in!
Maybe ya need someone bigger ta play wit'!
Go, little one! Fight dem! KILL DEM!
Who needs friends? Zanzil just makes his own!
Rise up! Zanzil's elixir gives ya life!
Enough.. enough of dis! Cower before da true power of Zanzil!
You'll all suffer for dis! Zul'Gurub is NOT'INk without Zan... Zan...
I will break you.
My fists are scarlet... with your blood!
If you die, you die!
I cannot be defeated! I be dormant!
You are like... piece of iron...
You shall pay for this treachery!
Mograine...
To think you've come so far, only to perish here. I'll honor you with clean deaths.
My legend begins NOW!
My blade is peerless!
Perfect technique!
But...my legend!
My endless agony shall be yours, as well!
Seek out a vessel...and return!
Claim a body, and wreak terrible vengeance!
Can this be...the end, at last...?
Lord Hir'eek, grant me wings of vengeance!
I command you to rain fire down upon these invaders!
Finally...death! Curse you, Hakkar! Curse you!
Minions of Hakkar, hear your God. The sanctity of this temple has been compromised. Invaders encroach upon holy ground! The Altar of Blood must be protected. Kill them all!
You dare set foot upon Hakkari holy ground? Minions of Hakkar, destroy the infidels!
PRIDE HERALDS THE END OF YOUR WORLD. COME, MORTALS! FACE THE WRATH OF THE SOULFLAYER!
Fleeing will do you no good, mortals!
Shirvallah, fill me with your RAGE!
Hakkar binds me no more! Peace at last!
Bethekk, your priestess calls upon your might!
Feast on them, my pretties!
At last, I am free of the Soulflayer!
Welcome to the great show, friends. Step right up to die!
Let the coils of hate unfurl!
Ssserenity... at lassst!
Make peace, worms. I be deliverin' you to Hakkar myself!
Ha ha ha! Is that all you got?
Your broken body belongs to Hakkar!
Fall to my feet. Fall to Mandokir, the bloodlord!
Off with your head!
Heads gonna roll!
Ding!
Go an' get dem, Ohgan! We WON'T be fooled again!
Rise, Ohgan! Rise, and fight for your master!
My blood feeds Hakkar! My soul... feeds... Jin'do!
How fortuitous. Usually, I must leave my lair in order to feed.
This meaningless exertion bores me. I'll incinerate you all from above!
It seems you'll need another lesson, mortals!
Learn your place, mortal!
You seek to lure me from my clutch? You shall pay for your insolence!
The runes of warding have been destroyed! Hunt down the infidels, my brethren!
Reckless mortals! None may challenge the Sons of the Living flame!
You think you've won already? Perhaps you'll need another lesson in pain!
Impossible! Stay your attack, mortal... I submit! I submit!
Brashly, you have come to wrest the secrets of the Living Flame! You will soon regret the recklessnss of your quest.
I go now to summon the lord whose house this is. Should you seek an audiance with him, your paltry lives will surely be forfeit! Nevertheless, seek out his lair, if you dare!
Imprudent whelps! You've rushed headlong to your own deaths! See now, the master stirs!
Behold Ragnaros - the Firelord! He who was ancient when this world was young! Bow before him, mortals! Bow before your ending!
These mortal infidels, my lord! They have invaded your sanctum and seek to steal your secrets!
TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS! WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS INTRUSION?
FOOL! YOU ALLOWED THESE INSECTS TO RUN RAMPANT THROUGH THE HALLOW CORE? AND NOW YOU LEAD THEM TO MY VERY LAIR? YOU HAVE FAILED ME, EXECUTUS! JUSTICE SHALL BE MET, INDEED!
NOW FOR YOU, INSECTS! BOLDLY, YOU SOUGHT THE POWER OF RAGNAROS. NOW YOU SHALL SEE IT FIRSTHAND!
DIE INSECT!
BY FIRE BE PURGED!
TASTE THE FLAMES OF SULFURON!
COME FORTH MY SERVANTS! DEFEND YOUR MASTER!
MY PATIENCE IS DWINDLING! COME, GNATS: TO YOUR DEATH!
No, not another one! I'll have your heads for this atrocity!
Fools! These eggs are more precious than you know!
You'll pay for forcing me to do this!
If I fall into the abyss, I'll take all of you mortals with me!
I'm free! That device shall never torment me again!
Do you expect me to cower before the mighty legion of yours? You are nothing to me. Less than nothing. Had I desired your head, it would have been: presented to me on a pike.
You have made the mistake that all mortals make.
Time does strange things to those that use it as a form of currency.
In your rush to glory, you assumed that the pace of this game revolved around your actions. Can you even fathom how preposterous that sounds to a being like me? A being that if so inclined could cause your own insignificant thoughts to crush the peanut sized mass of grey matter floating within your skull?
It's simple really! Allow me to summarize...
In this world where time is your enemy, it is my greatest ally. This grand game of life that you think you play in fact plays you. To that I say...Let the games begin!
Well done, my minions. The mortals' courage begins to wane! Now, let's see how they contend with the true Lord of Blackrock Spire!
Burn, you wretches! Burn!
Impossible! Rise my minions! Serve your master once more!
Death Knights, get over here!
Druids and your silly shapeshifting. Let's see it in action!
Hunters and your annoying pea-shooters!
Mages too? You should be more careful when you play with magic...
Monks, doesn't all that rolling make you dizzy?
Priests! If you're going to keep healing like that, we might as well make it a little more interesting!
Paladins, I've heard you have many lives. Show me.
Rogues? Stop hiding and face me!
Shamans, show me what your totems can do!
Warriors, I know you can hit harder than that! Let's see it!
Warlocks, you shouldn't be playing with magic you don't understand. See what happens?
Worthless wretch! Your friends will join you soon enough!
ENOUGH! Now you vermin shall feel the force of my birthright: The Fury of the Earth itself!
This cannot be! I am the Master here! You mortals are nothing to my kind! DO YOU HEAR? NOTHING!
None of your kind should be here. You've doomed only yourselves!
Clever, mortals. But I am not so easily lured away from my sanctum.
Too late...friends. Nefarius' corruption has taken hold. I cannot...control myself.
I beg you Mortals, flee! Flee before I lose all sense of control. The Black Fire rages within my heart. I must release it!
FLAME! DEATH! DESTRUCTION! COWER MORTALS BEFORE THE WRATH OF LORD....NO! I MUST FIGHT THIS! ALEXSTRASZA, HELP ME! I MUST FIGHT!
Nefarius' hate has made me stronger than ever before. You should have fled, while you could, mortals! The fury of Blackrock courses through my veins!
Forgive me friend, your death only adds to my failure.
At last the agony ends. I have failed you my Queen... I have failed us all...
The walls have been breached!
Sands of the desert, rise and block out the sun!
You are terminated.
I have... failed.
Soon you will know the price of your meddling, mortals... The master is nearly whole... And when he rises, your world will cease!
The time of our retribution is at hand! Let darkness reign in the hearts of our enemies!
No longer will we wait behind barred doors and walls of stone! No longer will our vengeance be denied! The dragons themselves will tremble before our wrath!
Fear is for the enemy! Fear and death!
Staghelm will whimper and beg for his life, just as his whelp of a son did! One thousand years of injustice will end this day!
Fandral! Your time has come! Go and hide in the Emerald Dream and pray we never find you!
Impudent fool! I will kill you myself!
Breath your last!
Warriors! Captains! Continue the fight!
Death is close...
You are already dead.
Your courage will fail.
Your friends will abandon you.
You will betray your friends.
You will die.
You are weak.
Your heart will explode.
PREPARE... for the return of the ancient ones!
Cower, mortals! The age of darkness is at hand!
The screams of the dying will fill the air! A symphony of terror is about to begin!
Spineless wretches! You will drown in rivers of blood!
Tremble! The end is upon you!
Are you so eager to die? I will be happy to accommodate you...
Let your death serve as an example!
You only delay... The inevitable...
Only flesh and bone. Mortals are such easy prey...
Where are your manners, brother. Let us properly welcome our guests.
There will be pain...
Oh so much pain...
Come, little ones.
The feast of souls begins now...
Ah, lambs to the slaughter.
Look brother, fresh blood.
Join me brother, there is blood to be shed. To decorate our halls
You will not escape death!
Oblivion will engulf you!
Like a fly in a web.Shall be your undoing!
Your brash arrogance...
Your fate is sealed!
You will not escape death!
Vek'lor, I feel your pain!
My brother...NO!
Prepare to embrace oblivion!
Let none survive!
It's too late to turn away.
You will be judged for defiling these sacred grounds! The laws of the Ancients will not be challenged! Trespassers will be annihilated!
I sentence you to death!
I serve to the last!
Foolishly you have sought your own demise. Brazenly you have disregarded powers beyond your understanding. You have fought hard to invade the realm of the harvester. Now there is only one way out - to walk the lonely path of the damned.
I have waited long enough! Now, you face the harvester of souls!
Death is the only escape.
I... am... undone!
Come out and fight, ye wee ninny!
Next time, bring more friends!
I like my meat extra crispy!
I'm gonna enjoy killin' these slack-jawed daffodils!
To arms, ye roustabouts! We've got company!
I heard about enough of yer sniveling. Shut yer fly trap 'afore I shut it for ye!
What a bloody waste this is!
I...I have no choice but to obey!
Forgive me!
Invaders, cease this foolish venture at once! Turn away while you still can!
Perhaps they will come to their senses, and run away as fast as they can!
Do not continue! Turn back while there's still time!
Flee, before it's too late!
It is... as it should be.
Defend yourself!
Who's next?
Your life is mine!
Come, Zeliek, do not drive them out. Not before we've had our fun.
I do hope they stay alive long enough for me to... introduce myself.
The first kill goes to me! Anyone care to wager?
Tou... ché!
Life is meaningless. It is in death that we are truly tested.
Enough prattling. Let them come! We shall grind their bones to dust.
Conserve your anger! Harness your rage! You will all have outlets for your frustration soon enough.
You seek death?
None shall pass!
Be still!
Bow to the might of the Highlord!
You will find no peace in death.
The master's will is done.
I...am...released! Perhaps it's not too late to—NOO! I need...more time...
You are mine now.
I see you...
You... are next.
Close your eyes. Sleep.
The races of the world will perish... it is only a matter of time.
I see endless suffering... I see torment... I see rage... I see everything.
Soon... the world will tremble.
The end is upon you.
Hungry worms will feast on your rotting flesh.
Hah hah, I'm just getting warmed up!
Stand and fight!
Show me what you've got!
You should've stayed home!
You disappoint me, students!
Do as I taught you!
Show them no mercy!
The time for practice is over! Show me what you've learned!
Sweep the leg! Do you have a problem with that?
An honorable... death... 
Ahh... welcome to my parlor.
I hear little hearts beating. Yesss... beating faster now. Soon the beating will stop.
Where to go? What to do? So many choices that all end in pain, end in death.
Which one shall I eat first? So difficult to choose. They all smell so delicious...
Closer now... tasty morsels. I've been too long without food. Without blood to drink.
Just a little taste...
There is no way out.
Yes, run! It makes the blood pump faster!
Shhh... it will all be over soon.
Your old lives, your mortal desires, mean nothing. You are acolytes of the master now, and you will serve the cause without question! The greatest glory is to die in the master's service!
Slay them in the master's name!
You cannot hide from me!
Kneel before me, worm!
Run while you still can!
You have failed!
Pathetic wretch!
The master... will avenge me!
You are too late... I... must... OBEY!
EAT YOUR BONES!
BREAK YOU!
Now YOU feel pain!
You die now!
Thank... you...
No!!! A curse upon you, interlopers! The armies of the Lich King will hunt you down. You will not escape your fate...
Who dares violate the sanctity of my domain? Be warned, all who trespass here are doomed.
Fools, you think yourselves triumphant? You have only taken one step closer to the abyss!
I grow tired of these games. Proceed, and I will banish your souls to oblivion!
You have no idea what horrors lie ahead. You have seen nothing! The frozen heart of Naxxramas awaits you!
Minions, servants, soldiers of the cold dark, obey the call of Kel'Thuzad!
Pray for mercy!
Scream your dying breath!
The end is upon you!
Master! I require aid!
Your petty magics are no challenge to the might of the Scourge!
Enough! I grow tired of these distractions!
Fools, you have spread your powers too thin. Be free, my minions!
Your soul, is bound to me now!
There will be no escape!
I will freeze the blood in your veins!
The dark void awaits you!
Agghhhh! Do...not...rejoice! Your victory is a hollow one, for I shall return with powers beyond your imagining!
Patchwerk want to play.
Kel'Thuzad make Patchwerk his avatar of war!
No more play?
What happened to... Patch...
Glory to the master!
Your life is forfeit.
Die trespasser!
Rise my soldiers! Rise, and fight once more!
My task is done.
Breathe no more.
I will serve the master... In... Death.
Kill...
Bow to the might of the Scourge!
Death will not stop me.
You have faced many challenges, pity they were all in vain. Soon your people will kneel to my lord!
Your time is running out!
You are nothing, I answer a higher call!
The Dark Lord laughs at you!
It is over. Finished!
Your days are done!
Is there no one left to test me?
My lord will be the end you all... 
Do you smell that? Fresh meat has somehow breached our citadel. Be wary of any intruders.
This may hurt a little...
What have we here?
I'm going to enjoy this...
Back off, pup!
Heal me, quickly!
Say farewell!
Much too easy...
You dare challenge me?!
I will not be defeated!
Achor-she-ki! Feast my pet! Eat your fill!
A-Kreesh!
Die, weakling!
I am victorious!
It is... not over. 
Your insolence, will be your death!
You dare stand against ME?
My work must not be interrupted.
Perhaps I can find a use for you.
Anger... Hate... These are tools I can use.
Let's see what I can make of you.
It is pointless to resist.
Stay away from... me.
Kill them!
Come, intruders...
Who dares interrupt--What is this, what have you done? You'll ruin everything!
Closer! Come closer... and burn!
Just as you deserve.
Your friends will soon be joining you.
Good... luck. You'll need it.
The work must continue.
Don't make me kill you!
You brought this on yourselves.
It had to be done.
You should not have come.
I... Deserve this.
I will end this quickly...
We fight to the death!
Acalah pek ecta!
Beast! Obey me! Kill them at once!
Krypta!
It is finished.
Well... done...
I will feed on your soul.
So... full of life!
Do not... resist.
Yes! I am... empowered!
More... I must have more!
To the void... once... more..
What is this? You must forgive me, but I was not expecting company. As you can see, we are somewhat preoccupied right now. But no matter. As I am a gracious host, I will tend to you... personally.
We have not yet been properly introduced.
An epic battle, how exciting!
I have such fascinating things to show you.
It has been... entertaining.
And now we part company.
I must bid you... farewell.
I have longed for a good adventure!
You have defiled the resting place of our ancestors. For this offense, there can be but one punishment. It is fitting that you have come to a place of the dead... for you will soon be joining them.
You will pay with your life!
There's no turning back now!
Serve your penitence!
Rise, my fallen brothers. Take form and fight!
Let your mind be clouded.
Stare into the darkness of your soul.
These walls will be your doom.
Now, you'll stay for eternity!
This is... where I belong.
I know what you're up to, and I mean to put an end to it, permanently!
Time to bleed!
Run, you blasted cowards!
You will not interfere!
Thrall... must not... go free.
No more meddling for you!
Thrall! Come outside and face your fate!
Taretha's life hangs in the balance. Surely you care for her. Surely you wish to save her...
Ah, there you are. I had hoped to accomplish this with a bit of subtlety, but I suppose direct confrontation was inevitable. Your future, Thrall, must not come to pass and so...you and your troublesome friends must die!
Enough! I will erase your very existence!
You cannot fight fate!
Not so fast!
Struggle as much as you like!
You are...irrelevant.
Thrall will remain a slave. Taretha will die. You have failed.
No!...The master... will not... be pleased.
Thrall! You didn't really think you would escape did you? You and your allies shall answer to Blackmoore - after I've had my fun!
You're a slave. That's all you'll ever be.
I don't know what Blackmoore sees in you. For my money, you're just another ignorant savage!
Thrall will never be free!
Did you really think you would leave here alive?
Guards! Urgh..Guards..!
Die like a dog!
HAH! How do you like THAT?!
Im... possible...
Ra-ak! Trinkets, yes. Pretty trinkets! Ak! Power, great power. Ra-kaw! Power in trinkets! Ak-caw!
Mmm, you make war on Ikiss? Aa-ak!
Ikiss cut you pretty, slice you yes!
No escape for- for you!
Mmmmmmmmmm!
You die! Stay away from trinkets!
Ikiss will not -- rak, rak -- die...
Hrrmm.. Time to.. hrrm.. make my move.
Nice pets..hrm.. Yes!
Nice pets have.. weapons. No so.. nice.
I have pets.. of my own!
Yes.. fleeting life is..
Uhn.. Be free..
No more life..hrm. No more pain.
The depths will consume you!
Meet your doom, surface dwellers!
You will drown in blood!
Enjoy the storm, warm bloods!
To the depths of oblivion with you!
For my Lady and Master!
Surge forth, my pets!
Our matron will be... the end of you.
You deem yourselves worthy simply because you bested my guards? Our work here will not be compromised!
Your head will roll!
I despise all of your kind!
Ba'anthalso-dorei!
This is not nearly over...
Squirm, surface filth!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
For her Excellency... for... Vashj!
I'm bringin' the pain!
You're in for a world of hurt!
Eat hot metal, scumbag!
I'll come over there!
Tune 'em up good boys!
You just got served, punk!
I own you!
Have fun dyin', cupcake!
Mommy!
Oh... Flesh must burn!
All creation must be unmade!
Power will be yours!
Be ready for Dark One's return.
So we have place new universe!
Dark One promise!
You'll be sorry!
Time for fun!
I see dead people!
Time to kill!
You be dead people!
That right!
No coming back for you!
Nice try!
Now you gone for good!
You fail!
Help us! Hurry!
Help...NOW!
This... no... good...
Infidels have invaded the sanctuary! Sniveling pests... You have yet to learn the true meaning of agony!
Pathetic mortals! You will pay dearly!
I will break you!
Finally, something to relieve the tedium.
Do you fear death?
This is the part I enjoy most...
Aid me, you fools, before it's too late!
Do not...grow...overconfident, mortal.
Keep your minds focused for the days of reckoning are close at hand. Soon, the destroyer of worlds will return to make good on his promise. Soon the destruction of all that is will begin!
I'll make an offering of your blood.
You'll be a fine example for the others.
Good! A worthy sacrifice!
Come to my aid! Heed your master now!
The darkness in your souls draws you ever closer...
I serve with pride!
Your death is for the greater cause!
Fools.
I give my life... gladly...
If you nice me let you live. No, we will NOT let you live!
Me hungry! You always hungry. That why we so fat!
Smash! Why don't you let me do the talking?
You stay here. Me go kill someone else! That's not funny! Ha ha ha.
Me not like this one... I'm not done yet, idiot!
Hey, you numbskull! We kill his friend!
This one die easy! That's because I do all the hard work!
I'm tired. You kill next one!
This all...your fault! I...hate...you!
Archers, form ranks! On my mark!
Aim!
Ready!
Fire!
Run, coward, run!
Your pain amuses me!
Beg for your pitiful life!
You want him? Very well, take him!
You can have that one, I no longer need him!
Yes, beat him mercilessly! His skull is as thick as an ogre's!
Don't waste your time on that one, he's weak!
One pitiful wretch down. Go on, take another one!
I was going to kill him anyway!
Ah, what a waste... next!
Thank you for saving me the trouble. Now it's my turn to have some fun!
You wish to fight us all at once? This should be amusing!
You lose.
I had more fun torturing the peons!
I'm already bored!
What... a shame.
Come on, show me a real fight!
Oh, just die!
It looks like we have a ranking officer among our captives...how amusing. Execute the green-skinned dog at once!
Ours is the TRUE Horde! The only Horde!
I'll grind the meat from your bones!
I am called Bladefist for a reason. As you will see.
I am the ONLY warchief!
For the real Horde!
Cowards! You'll never pull me into the shadows!
The true Horde... will prevail.
I predict a painful death.
Measure twice; cut once.
Yes, the only logical outcome.
If my division is correct, you should be quite dead.
Your strategy was flawed.
An unforeseen... contingency.
I've been waiting for you!
We are on a strict timetable. You will not interfere!
I'm looking for a team player...
You work for me now!
Looks like you lose.
Time to supplement my work force.
I prefer to be hands-on...
A minor inconvenience.
The project will... continue.
You have approximately five seconds to live.
With the precise angle and velocity...
A foregone conclusion.
My calculations did not... 
Low tech, but quite effective!
The processing will continue as scheduled.
You should split while you can.
Go ahead, gimme your best shot. I can take it!
Think you can hurt me, huh? Think I'm afraid a' you?
Damn, I'm good!
Bully!
Can't say I didn't warn you..
Don't value your life very much, do you?
Endala finel endal!
And don't come back!
Anar'endal dracon!
Think you can take the heat?
Anu... bala belore...alon.
I am not alone...
Who disturbs this sanctuary?
Children, come to me!
Maybe this is not-- No, we fight! Come to my aid!
What am I doing? Why do I...
You must die! But wait: this does not-- No, no... you must die!
So... confused. Do not... belong here!
What are you doing? These specimens are very delicate!
Nature bends to my will...
Your life cycle is now complete!
Endorel aluminor!
You will feed the worms!
The specimens...must be preserved.
What aggravation is this? You will die!
Scream while you burn!
I'll incinerate you!
I revel in your pain!
You seek a prize, eh? How about death?
Your life will be mine!
I hate to say I told you so...
You won't... get far.
We must not fail our leader! Kael'thas will redeem us!
Step forward! I will see that you are properly welcomed.
Oh stop your whimpering.
Mission accomplished.
Guards! Come and kill these intruders!
You are no longer dealing with some underling.
Band'or shorel'aran!
I have not yet...begun to...
Why do you persist? Surely you can see the futility of it all. It is not too late! You may still leave with your lives ...
So be it ... you have been warned.
You should have left when you had the chance.
Your days are done.
Time Keeper! The sands of time have run out for you.
My death means ... little.
Why do you aid the Magus? Just think of how many lives could be saved if the portal is never opened, if the resulting wars could be erased...
If you will not cease this foolish quest, then you will die!
You have outstayed your welcome, Keeper. Begone!
I told you it was a fool's quest!
Leaving so soon?
Time ... is on our side.
The time has come to shatter this clockwork universe forever! Let us no longer be slaves of the hourglass! I warn you: those who do not embrace the greater path shall become victims of its passing!
Let us see what fate lays in store...
Your time is up, slave of the past!
No one can stop us! No one!
One less obstacle in our way!
We will triumph.. It is only a matter...of time.
It is unwise to anger me.
Ahh... That is much better.
Ahh... Just what I needed.
Completely ineffective. Just like someone else I know.
You chose the wrong opponent.
I'll cut you to pieces!
Reap the Whirlwind!
Now I'm really... angry...
Don't worry about me; kill that worthless dullard instead!
More than you can handle, scryer?
Congratulations. I've wanted to do that for years.
I suppose I'll end up fighting them all myself.
I've grown used to cleaning up your messes.
Life energy to... consume.
The shadow... will engulf you.
Darkness...consumes...all.
This vessel...is empty.
No...more...life.
The Void... beckons.
It is a small matter to control the mind of the weak... for I bear allegiance to powers untouched by time, unmoved by fate. No force on this world or beyond harbors the strength to bend our knee... not even the mighty Legion!
Bear witness to the agent of your demise!
I will show you horrors undreamed of.
Flee in terror.
Your will is no longer your own.
You will do my bidding, weakling.
We span the universe, as countless as the stars!
The chaos I have sown here is but a taste....
Your fate is written!
I am merely one of... infinite multitudes.
At last, a target for my frustrations!
On guard!
Defend yourself, for all the good it will do...
Yes, that was quite satisfying.
Knew this was... the only way out.
Have you come to kill Dalliah? Can I watch?
Facing difficulties, Dalliah? How nice.
I suggest a new strategy, you draw the attackers while I gather reinforcements. Hahaha!
Finally! Well done!
This may be the end for you Dalliah! What a shame that will be.
You only waste my time!
My hunger knows no bounds!
Yes! I am a god!
No! More... I must have more!
Enough distractions!
I am invincible!
Don't look so smug! I know what you're thinking, but Tempest Keep was merely a set back. Did you honestly believe I would trust the future to some blind, half-night elf mongrel? Oh no, no, no, he was merely an instrument, a stepping stone to a much larger plan! It has all led to this...and this time, you will not interfere!
Felomin ashal!
Vengeance burns!
I'll turn your world...upside...down.
Master, grant me strength.
Do not get...too comfortable.
My demise accomplishes nothing! The Master will have you! You will drown in your own blood! The world shall burn!
Annihilate them!
 Oh, the horror.
Well aren't you lucky?
Now I'm getting annoyed.
Lackies be damned! I'll finish you myself!
I call that a good start.
I could have sworn there were more of you.
 Not really much of a group anymore, is it?
One is such a lonely number.
It's been a kick, really.
Not what I had... planned.
Drain... life...
Un...con...tainable.
Un...leash...
Con...sume.
The Menagerie is for guests only.
This curator is equipped for gallery protection.
Gallery rules will be strictly enforced.
Your request cannot be processed.
Failure to comply will result in offensive action.
You are not a guest.
Do not touch the displays.
Curator is no longer op... er... ation... al.
Very well. Let the game begin.
Perhaps a change is in order.
Time for an alternative scenario.
One must not become too complacent.
Let us see.
A transparent stratagem.
Ah, the wheels have begun to turn.
Hmm.
No matter.
Interesting
Foolish! Very foolish!
A minor concern.
Yes... all according to plan.
Yes...of course.
The slightest loss of concentration is all it takes.
A necessary sacrifice.
Now it gets interesting.
Ahh, I should have known.
As it should be.
And so, the end draws near.
Nothing less than perfection will do.
And so it ends.
Who dares attack the steed of The Huntsman?
Perhaps you would rather test yourselves against a more formidable opponent?!
Cowards! Wretches!
Weapons are merely a convenience for a warrior of my skill!
Come Midnight, let's disperse this petty rabble!
Another trophy to add to my collection!
It was... inevitable.
Such easy sport!
Amateurs! Do not think you can best me! I kill for a living!
Well done Midnight!
Always knew... someday I would become... the hunted.
Madness has brought you here to me. I shall be your undoing!
You face not Malchezaar alone, but the legions I command!
All realities, all dimensions are open to me!
Simple fools! Time is the fire in which you'll burn!
How can you hope to withstand such overwhelming power?
You are but a plaything, unfit even to amuse.
Your greed, your foolishness has brought you to this end.
Surely you did not think you could win.
I refuse to concede defeat. I am a prince of the Eredar! I am...
Who knows what secrets hide in the dark? Ah...yes, I do!
The celestial forces are MINE to manipulate!
All the better to own you with!
Run away little girl, run away!
Mmmm... delicious.
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
Romulo, I come! Oh... this do I drink to thee!
Come, gentle night; and give me back my Romulo!
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Where is my Lord? Where is my Romulo? Ohh, happy dagger! This is thy sheath! There rust, and let me die!
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
Thou smilest... upon the stroke that... murders me.
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death; I enforce thy rotten jaws to open!
How well my comfort is revived by this!
This day's black fate on more days doth depend. This but begins the woe. Others must end.
Hmm, unannounced visitors, Preparations must be made...
Now, where was I? Oh yes...
You rang?
I've gone and made a mess.
One more for dinner this evening.
Time... Never enough time.
The Master will return from Stormwind soon.
How terribly clumsy of me...
I've longed for this.
Ah, you're just in time. The rituals are about to begin.
Please, accept this humble offering, oh great one.
Let the sacrifice serve his testament to my fealty.
Come, you dwellers in the dark. Rally to my call!
Gather, my pets. There is plenty for all.
Your blood will anoint my circle.
The great one will be pleased.
My life, is yours. Oh great one.
Please, no more! My son... he's gone mad!
Who are you? What do you want?! Stay away from me!
I will not be tortured again!
Burn you hellish fiends!
I'll show you this beaten dog still has some teeth!
Back to the cold dark with you!
I'll freeze you all!
Yes, yes, my son is quite powerful... but I have powers of my own!
I am not some simple jester! I am Nielas Aran!
Surely you would not deny an old man a replenishing drink? No, no I thought not.
I'm not finished yet! No, I have a few more tricks up my sleeve.
Torment me no more!
I want this nightmare to be over!
You've wasted enough of my time... let these games be finished
At last the nightmare is over...
Where did you get that?! Did HE send you??
I smell... orc. Delicious!
I shall consume you!
Drink, mortals! Taste my blood! Taste your death!
Your behavior will not be tolerated.
Cast out your corrupt thoughts.
Your impurity must be cleansed.
Impure thoughts lead to profane actions.
Ah ah ah...
This is for the best.
Death comes. Will your conscience be clear?
Come...and die.
Scurry.
No escape.
Stay...
Beg for life.
No more.
Unworthy.
Die.
Gronn are the real power in Outland!
You not kill next one so easy!
Good, now you fight me!
Pah! Does not prove anything!
You will not defeat the Hand of Gruul!
Maulgar is king!
You not so tough after all!
I'm not afraid of you!
Gruul will... crush you!
How long do you believe your pathetic sorcery can hold me?
Illidan is an arrogant fool! I will crush him and reclaim Outland as my own!
Wretched, meddling insects! Release me, and perhaps I will grant you a merciful death!
Away, you mindless parasites! My blood is my own!
Vermin! Leeches! Take my blood and choke on it!
My blood will be the end of you!
Thank you for releasing me. Now... die!
Not again... NOT AGAIN!
I... am... UNLEASHED!!!
I will not be taken so easily. Let the walls of this prison tremble... and FALL!!!
Did you think me weak? Soft? Who is the weak one now?!
The Legion... will consume you... all....
Get da move on, guards! It be killin' time!
What could be better than servin' da bear spirit for eternity? Come closer now. Bring your souls to me!

De Zandalari give us strength. Nobody push around de Amani no more!
Oh, look you... dead.
This is why they call me.. invincible!
Water is life. It has become a rare commodity here in Outland. A commodity that we alone shall control. We are the Highborne, and the time has come at last for us to retake our rightful place in the world!
I'll split you from stem to stern!
Victory to Lord Illidan!
I spit on you, surface filth!
Death to the outsiders!
I did not wish to lower myself by engaging your kind, but you leave me little choice!
The time is now! Leave none standing!
You may want to take cover.
Straight to the heart!
Seek your mark!
Your time ends now!
You have failed!
Be'lemer an-delei!
Lord Illidan, I... I am... sorry.
Guards, attention! We have visitors....
I am rid of you.
Land-dwelling scum!
More knowledge, more power!
I am more powerful than ever!
Go on, kill them! I'll be the better for it!
Alana be'lendor!
Your overconfidence will be your undoing! Guards, lend me your strength!
Her... excellency... awaits!
I cannot allow you to interfere!
Aaghh, the poison...
Better, much better.
They have forced me to this...
I have no choice.
You are no better than they!
I will purge you from this place.
I am... released...
You are the disease, not I.
Finally my banishment ends!
Be gone trifling elf. I'm in control now.
We all have our demons..
Kill! KILL!
That's right! Yes!
Who's the master now?
I have no equal
Perish, mortal.
Yes, YES! Ahahah!
No... no! What have you done? I am the master! Do you hear me? I am... aaggh! Can't... contain him.
At last I am liberated. It has been too long since I have tasted true freedom!
You cannot kill me, fools! I'll be back, I'll....
Flood of the Deep, take you!
Only the strong survive.
Struggling only makes it worse.
It is done!
By the Tides!
Destroy them my subjects!
Soon it will be finished!
There is nowhere to hide!
Great... currents of... Ageon.
Tal anu'men no Sin'dorei!
I will crush your delusions of grandeur!
Ha ha ha! You are hopelessly outmatched!
Enough of this! Now I call upon the fury of the cosmos itself.
I become ONE... with the VOID!
Your soul belongs to the Abyss!
By the blood of the Highborne!
For the Sunwell!
The warmth of the sun... awaits.
Energy. Power. My people are addicted to it. Their dependence made manifest after the Sunwell was destroyed. Welcome to the future...a pity you're too late to stop it. No one can stop me now. Selama ashal'anore.
Let us see how your nerves hold up against the Darkener, Thaladred.
You have persevered against some of my best advisors. But none can withstand the might of the Bloodhammer. Behold, Lord Sanguinar.
Capernian will see to it that your stay here is a short one.
Well done. You have proven worthy to test your skills against my Master Engineer, Telonicus.
As you can see, I have many weapons in my arsenal.
Perhaps I underestimated you. It would be unfair to make you fight all four Advisors at once, but...fair treatment was never shown to my people. I'm just returning the favor.
Alas, sometimes one must take matters into one's own hands. Balamore shanal!
Obey me.
Bow to my will.
Anara'nel belore!
By the power of the sun!
I have not come this far to be stopped! The future I have planned will not be jeopardized! Now, you will taste true power!
Having trouble staying grounded?
Let us see how you fare when your world is turned upside down.
You will not prevail.
You gambled...and lost.
This was Child's play.
For...Quel...thalas!
Alert! You are marked for Extermination!
Alternative measure commencing...
Calculating force parameters...
Invasive lifeform no longer functional
Extermination successful
Threat neutralized
Systems... shutting... d-o-w-n...
You are defenders of a doomed world. Flee here and perhaps you will prolong your pathetic lives.
The swarm is eager to feed.
Pestilence upon you!
You look tired.
Sweet dreams.
Scream for me.
Pity, no time for a slow death.
Your hopes, are lost.
Earth and Sky shall burn!
Let fire rain from above!
The clock... is still... ticking.
All of your efforts have been in vain, for the draining of the World Tree has already begun. Soon the heart of your world will beat no more.
Your resistance is insignificant!
This world will burn!
Manach sheek-thrish!
Away vermin!
A-kreesh!
Your soul will languish for eternity.
All creation will be devoured!
I am the coming of the end!
At last it is here. Mourn and lament the passing of all you have ever known and all that would have been! Akmin-kurai!
You are mine now.
Bow to my will.
No, it cannot be! Nooo!
The Legion's final conquest has begun! Once again the subjugation of this world is within our grasp. Let none survive!
Succumb to the icy chill... of death!
It will be much colder in your grave.
Crumble and rot!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
All life must perish!
Victory to the Legion!
Your world is ours now!
You have won this battle, but not... the... war.
Cry for mercy! Your meaningless lives will soon be forfeit.
Your death will be a painful one.
You... are marked.
Miserable nuisance!
You... are nothing!
Shaza-kiel!
Hah hah hah haa...
Abandon all hope! The legion has returned to finish what was begun so many years ago. This time there will be no escape!
Reesh, hokta!
No one is going to save you.
Don't fight it.
Just a taste... of what awaits you.
Suffer you despicable insect!
Your time is almost... up.
So, business... or pleasure?
You play, you pay.
I'm not impressed.
Enjoying yourselves?
You seem a little tense.
Don't be shy.
I'm all yours.
Easy come, easy go.
So much for a happy ending.
Stop toying with my emotions!
I wasn't finished.
I was the first, you know. For me, the wheel of death has spun many times. So much time has passed. I have a lot of catching up to do...
Vengeance is mine!
I have use for you!
It gets worse...
Death... Really isn't so bad.
I have something for you...
YOU WILL SHOW THE PROPER RESPECT!
What are you afraid of?
Give in!
The wheel... spins... again...
Don't leave me alone!
Pain and suffering, are all that await you.
Look at what you made me do.
I didn't ask for this!
The pain is only beginning!
I don't want to go back...!
Now what do I do?!
You can have anything you desire... for a price.
Fulfillment is at hand.
Yes, you'll stay with us now.
Your reach exceeds your grasp.
I'll be waiting.
Be careful what you wish for.
I won't be far...
Beware - I live.
So foolish!
Enough, no more!
I won't be ignored.
On your knees!
Beware, cowards!
Horde will crush you!
Drink your blood! Eat your flesh!
I hunger!
Time to feast!
More! I want more!
I'll rip the meat from your bones!
You will die, in the name of Lady Vashj!
Stick around!
I'll deal with you later!
Be'lanen dalorai!
Blood will flow!
My patience has run out! Die, die!
Bal, lamer zhita!
Your success was short lived!
Time for you... to go!
Lord Illidan will... crush you.
Enough! Taste the full fury of High Warlord Naj'entus!
Flee, or die.
My work is done.
As it should be.
No. Second. Chances.
I'm full of surprises...!
FOR QUEL'THALAS! FOR THE SUNWELL!
Destiny... awaits...
I have better things to do.
Well done.
Enjoy your final moments.
You are mine.
Enough games!
Lord Illidan... I...
Common. Such a crude language. Ban'dal!
Sha'amoor ara mashal?
Shorel'aran.
Diel ma'ahn... orindel'o.
You wish to test me?
Valiant effort.
A glorious kill.
You're not cut out for this!
You wish to kill me?! You first!
You got lucky...
Anara'nel belore!
Akama. Your duplicity is hardly surprising. I should have slaughtered you and your malformed brethren long ago.
Boldly said. But I remain...unconvinced.
You are not prepared!
Come, my minions. Deal with this traitor as he deserves!
Feel the hatred of ten thousand years!
Who shall be next to taste my blades?!
This is too easy!
I will not be touched by rabble such as you!
Behold the flames of Azzinoth!
Such arrogance!
Stare into the eyes of the Betrayer!
Behold the power... of the demon within!
You've wasted too much time mortals, now you shall fall!
I can feel your hatred...
Give in to your fear!
You know nothing of power!
Is this it, mortals? Is this all the fury you can muster?
Maiev...How is it even possible?
You have won...Maiev. But the huntress...is nothing without the hunt. You...are nothing...without me.
All my plans have led to this!
Stay on task! Do not waste time!
I have waited long enough!
Fail me, and suffer for eternity!
Drain the girl! Drain her power until there is nothing but a vacant shell!
The expendible have perished... So be it! Now I shall succeed where Sargeras could not! I will bleed this wretched world and secure my place as the true master of the Burning Legion. The end has come! Let the unraveling of this world commence!
Chaos!
Destruction!
Oblivion!
Another step towards destruction!
Anukh-Kyrie!
Who can you trust?
The enemy is among you.
I will not be denied! This world shall fall!
Do not harbor false hope. You cannot win!
Aggghh! The powers of the Sunwell... turn... against me! What have you done? What have you done???
Nooooooooooooo!
Puny lizard! Death is the only answer you'll find here!
Grah! Your magic is weak!
That was fun, but I still await a true challenge!
Come, try your luck!
Ahh! More lambs to the slaughter!
I will crush you!
Perish, insect!
You are meat!
Too easy!
Bring the fight to me!
Another day, another glorious battle!
I live for this!
So much for a real challenge... Die!
Gah! Well done... Now... this gets... interesting...
Misery...confusion...mistrust. These are the hallmarks.
Depravity...hatred...chaos. These are the pillars.
Fire to the aid of shadow!
Shadow to the aid of fire!
Fires consume.
Edir harach!
Shadows engulf.
Ee-nok Kryul!
Sacrolash!
Your fire burns within me!
Your luck has run its course!
Time is a luxury you no longer possess!
Der'ek... manul.
I... fade.
No longer will I be a slave to Malygos! Challenge me and you will be destroyed!
My awakening is complete! You shall all perish!
I will purge you!
Your pain has only begun!
In the name of Kil'jaeden!
You were warned!
I need... your help... Cannot... resist him... much longer...
Aaahhh! Help me, before I lose my mind!
Hurry! There is not much of me left!
I am forever in your debt. Once we have triumphed over Kil'jaeden, this entire world will be in your debt as well.
Glory to Kil'jaeden! Death to all who oppose!
I kill for the master!
The end has come!
Choke on your final breath!
I am stronger than ever before!
No more hesitation! Your fates are written!
Kil'jaeden... will... prevail...
Dalronn! See if you can muster the nerve to join my attack!
Pagh! What sort of necromancer lets death stop him? I knew you were worthless!
Not... over... yet.
Jarggn olkt!
A warrior's death.
Your blood is mine!
Aranal, ledel! Their fate shall be yours!
Not so fast.
I join... the night.
Darkness waits.
By all means, don't assess the situation, you halfwit! Just jump into the fray!
See... you... soon.
Skarvald, you incompetent slug! Return and make yourself useful!
There's no... greater... glory.
I'll paint my face with your blood!
My life for the... Death God!
I return! A second chance to carve your skull!
Mjul orm agn gjor!
I am a warrior born!
No! I can do... better! I can...
Preserve? Why? There's no truth in it. No no no... only in the taking! I see that now!
Stay. Enjoy your final moments.
Now we've come to the truth!
Finish it! Finish it! Kill me, or I swear by the Dragonqueen you'll never see daylight again!
Dragonqueen... Life-Binder... preserve... me.
Noo!
Bleed!
Back!
Aaggh!
Killed them...
You know what they say about curiosity.
There's plenty of me to go around.
I'll give you more than you can handle.
Now to finish the job!
Death becomes you!
Damn the... luck.
What? Where in the...don't just stand around, lads! Kill somebody!
Now we're gettin' somewhere!
Is that all you...got...
What is this? Mok-thorin ka! Kill them!
Our task is not yet done!
Gaagh...
Chaos beckons.
Reality... unwoven.
Indestructible.
Expiration is neccesary.
Of course.
I will feast on your remains.
Your heartbeat is music to my ears.
I am nowhere. I am everywhere. I am the watcher, unseen.
So appetizing.
Fresh, warm blood. It has been too long.
I will drink no blood before it's time.
One final embrace.
Still I hunger, still I thirst.
Bindori Abovel.
They who dine on lost souls know only hunger.
Gaze into the void. It is the perpetuity in which they dwell.
They drink your fear: it is the blood of life.
They are the whisper on the shivering wind.
They do not die; they do not live. They are outside the cycle.
Where one falls, many shall take its place.
The elements themselves will rise up against the civilized world! Only the faithful will be spared!
Immortality can be yours. But only if you pledge yourself fully to Yogg-Saron!
Here on the very borders of his domain. You will experience powers you would never have imagined!
You have traveled long and risked much to be here. Your devotion shall be rewarded.
The faithful shall be exalted! But there is more work to be done. We will press on until all of Azeroth lies beneath his shadow!
These are sacred halls! Your intrusion will be met with death.
Who among you is devoted?
You there! Step forward!
Yogg-Saron, grant me your power!
Master, a gift for you!
Glory to Yogg-Saron!
You are unworthy!
Get up! You haven't suffered enough.
Do not expect your sacrilege... to go unpunished.
The secrets of the deep shall remain hidden.
The young must not grow hungry...
Shhhad ak kereeesshh chak-k-k!
Sleep now, in the cold dark.
For the Lich King!
Perhaps we will be allies soon.
Master, is my service complete?
Keep an eye on the tunnel. We must not let anyone through!
I hear footsteps. Be on your guard.
I sense the living. Be ready.
This kingdom belongs to the Scourge! Only the dead may enter.
We are besieged. Strike out and bring back their corpses!
We must hold the gate. Attack! Tear them limb from limb!
The gate must be protected at all costs. Rip them to shreds!
They hunger.
Dinner time, my pets.
You were foolish to come.
As Anub'Arak commands!
Hush-tak Hee-tah!
I should be grateful, but I long ago lost the capacity...
I was king of this empire once, long ago. In life I stood as champion. In death I returned as conqueror. Now I protect the kingdom once more. Ironic, yes?
Eternal agony awaits you!
You shall experience my torment, first-hand!
You have made your choice.
Soon, the Master's voice will call to you.
Your armor is useless against my locusts!
The pestilence upon you!
Uunak-hissss tik-k-k-k-k!
Come forth, my brethren. Feast on their flesh!
Auum na-l ak-k-k-k, isshhh.
Never thought... I would be free of him...
The chill that you feel is the herald of your doom!
Surely you can see the futility of it all!
Just give up and die already!
Bolster my defenses! Hurry, curse you!
Such is the fate of all who oppose the Lich King.
Your efforts... are in vain.
Corpse go boom!
So hungry! Must feed!
Me gonna carve you and eat you!
Tharon'ja sees all! The work of mortals shall not end the eternal dynasty!
Your flesh serves Tharon'ja now!
Tharon'ja has a use for your mortal shell!
No! A taste...all too brief!
Agghh! Tharon'ja will have more!
As Tharon'ja predicted!
As it was written!
Im...impossible! Tharon'ja is eternal! Tharon'ja...is...
A valiant defense, but this city must be razed. I will fulfill Malygos's wishes myself!
We finish this now, champions of Kirin Tor!
Shiver and die!
Am I interrupting?
The world has forgotten what true magic is! Let this be a reminder!
Who among you can withstand my power?
I will end the Kirin Tor!
Dalaran will fall!
So ends your defiance of the Spell-Weaver!
Perhaps... we have... underestimated... you.
I am... renewed.
Eradicate.
Know... my... pain.
Gaze... into the void.
More... energy.
Relinquish.
Fall... to shadow.
Disperse.
Free to--mm--fly now. Ra-aak... Not find us--ekh-ekh! Escape!
Not--caww--get in way of--rrak-rrak--flee!
My---raaak--favorite! Awk awk awk! Raa-kaa!
Nasty little...A-ak, kaw! Kill! Yes, kill you!
Kaw-Kaw!
Only strong, Aak, survive!
Precious life, Awk, wasted!
No--kaw, kaw--flee...
Back in business! Now to execute an exit strategy.
It seems my freedom must be bought with blood...
It would seem that a renegotiation is in order.
Intriguing... a high quantity of arcane energy is near. Time for some prospecting...
The air teems with latent energy... quite the harvest!
Plentiful, exploitable resources... primed for acquisition!
Nothing personal.
Business concluded.
Profit!
This is an... unrecoverable... loss.
I... am fury... unrestrained!
Stand aside, mortals!
I will not be contained! Ngyah!!
Water can hold any form, take any shape... overcome any obstacle.
I am a force of nature!
I shall pass!
You can not stop the tide!
I shall consume, decimate, devastate, and destroy! Yield now to the wrath of the pounding sea!
I... recede.
Drakkari gonna kill anybody who tressspasss on these landsss!
A thousssand fangs gonna rend your flesh!
Minionsss of the scale, heed my call!
Ye not breathin'! Good.
You ssscared now?
I'll eat you next, mon!
I sssee now... Ssscourge wasss not... our greatessst enemy...
We fought back da Scourge! What chance joo thinkin' JOO got?
Da ground gonna swallow you up!
Get ready for somethin'... much... BIGGAH!
I crush you, cockroaches!
Who gonna stop me; you?
Not so tough now.
If our gods can die... den so can we...
I'm gonna spill your guts, mon!
Ain't gonna be nottin' left after this!
You wanna see power? I'm gonna show you power!
Gut them! Impale them!
KILL THEM ALL!
Say hello to my BIG friend!
What a rush!
Who needs gods, when WE ARE GODS!
I told ya so!
Even the mighty... can fall.
Crush....
Break.... you....
Ha...ha...ha...ha...
Uuuuhhhhhhhhhh......

You shouldn't have come...now you will die!
Why must it be this way?
You had it coming!
My burden grows heavier.
This is your own fault!
So much lost time... that you'll never get back!
I hope you all rot! I never...wanted...this.
Soft, vulnerable shells. Brief, fragile lives. You can not escape the curse of flesh!
Flesh is no match for iron!
Armies of iron will smother the world!
Folvynn buul hrom onn!
Loken will not rest... until the forge is retaken! You change... nothing!
It is you who have destroyed my children? You... shall... pay!
Life from the lifelessness... death for you.
Nothing is wasted in the process. You will see...
I will crush you beneath my boots!
All my work... undone!
The armies of iron will conquer all!
Ha, pathetic!
You have cost me too much work!
The master was right... to be concerned.
You wish to confront the master? You must first weather the storm!
The slightest spark shall be your undoing.
No one is safe!
Shocking, I know
You attempt the impossible
Your spark of life is..extinguished!
Master... you have guests.
I have witnessed the rise and fall of empires... the birth and extinction of entire species... Over countless millennia the foolishness of mortals has remained the only constant. Your presence here confirms this.
My master has shown me the future, and you have no place in it. Azeroth will be reborn in darkness. Yogg-Saron shall be released! The Pantheon shall fall!
What hope is there for you? None!
You cannot hide from fate!
Come closer. I will make it quick.
Your flesh cannot hold out for long.
You stare blindly into the abyss!
Your ignorance is profound. Can you not see where this path leads?
You cross the precipice of oblivion!
Only mortal...
I... am... FOREVER!
What little time you had, you wasted!
My death... heralds the end of this world.
I am the greatest of my father's sons! Your end has come!
Defend yourself, for all the good it will do!
Give me your worst!
GRAAAAAH! Behold the fury of iron and steel!
So ends your curse!
Flesh... is... weak!
Bolvin umyol marnjar.
How can it be...? Flesh is not... stronger!
Simpletons! You cannot comprehend the forces you have set in motion. The ley line conduit will not be disrupted! Your defeat shall be absolute!
You brash interlopers are out of your element! I will ground you!
We command the arcane! It shall not be used against us.
It is trivial to extinguish your fire!
No magic of nature will help you now!
Such insolence... such arrogance... must be PUNISHED!
It's a long way down...
Back to the earth with you!
Enjoy the fall!
Savor this small victory, foolish little creatures. You and your dragon allies have won this battle. But we will win... the Nexus War.
What do we have here... those would defy the Spell-Weaver? Those without foresight or understanding. How could I make you see? Malygos is saving the world from itself! Bah! You are hardly worth my time!
Clearly my pets failed. Perhaps another demonstration is in order.
Still you fight. Still you cling to misguided principles. If you survive, you'll find me in the center ring.
Poor blind fools!
A taste... just a small taste... of the Spell-Weaver's power!
So much unstable energy... but worth the risk to destroy you!
If only you understood!
Now do you see? Do you?!
Unfortunate, but necessary.
Everything I've done... has been for Azeroth...
The prisoners shall not go free. The word of Malygos is law!
It is too late to run!
Gather 'round...
None shall escape!
I condemn you to death!
Tremble, worms!
I will crush you!
Can you fly?
A fitting punishment!
Sentence: executed!
Another casualty of war!
The war... goes on.
Intruders, your victory will be short-lived. I am Commander Varos Cloudstrider. My drakes control the skies and protect this conduit. I will see to it personnaly that the Oculus does not fall into your hands!
There will be no mercy!
Blast them! Destroy them!
Take no prisoners! Attack!
Strike now! Obliterate them!
They are... too strong! Underestimated their... fortitude.
You were warned!
The Oculus is ours!
Yes, this is the beginning. I've been waiting for you, young prince. I am Mal'Ganis.
As you can see, your people are now mine. I will now turn this city, household by household, until the flame of life has been snuffed out forever.
This will be a fine test, Prince Arthas.
Time out.
You seem tired.
All too easy.
The dark lord is displeased with your interference.
 is Prince Arthas I want, not you.
Your journey has just begun, young prince. Gather your forces, and meet me in the arctic land of Northrend. It is there we shall settle the score between us. It is there that your true destiny will unfold.
Prince Arthas Menethil, on this day, a powerful darkness has taken hold of your soul. The death you are destined to visit upon others will this day be your own.
We'll see about that, young prince.
Tick tock, tick tock...
Not quick enough!
Let's get this over with.
There is no future for you.
This is the hour of our greatest triumph!
You were destined to fail.
Play time!
New toys!
Boring...
Why you stop moving?
Get up! Me not done!
This not fun...
You are too late, champion of Lordaeron. The dead shall have their day.
Ah, the entertainment has arrived!
BOOM! Hahahahah...
Blood... destruction... EXHILARATING!
I want a sample...
Such strength... it must be mine!
Your flesh betrays you.
Say hello to some friends of mine.
Come, citizen of Stratholme! Meet your saviors.
The fun is just beginning!
Aah, quality materials!
Don't worry, I'll make good use of you.
You only advance... the master's plan...
How dare you interfere with our work here!
My work here is finished!
My time... has run out...
What this place? I will destroy you!
You die! That what master wants!
An easy task!
My liege! I have done as you asked, and now beseech you for your blessing!
The sensation is... beyond my imagining. I am yours to command, my king.
I will be happy to slaughter them in your name! Come, enemies of the Scourge! I will show you the might of the Lich King!
I will vanquish your soul!
Your death approaches.
Go now to my master.
Your end is inevitable.
Any last words?
You were a fool to challenge the power of the Lich King!
Your will is done, my king.
Another soul for my master.
Nooo! I did not come this far... to...
You invade my home and then dare to challenge me? I will tear the hearts from your chests and offer them as gifts to the death god! Rualg nja gaborr!
Bjorn of the Black Storm! Honor me now with your presence!
Haldor of the Rocky Cliffs, grant me your strength!
Ranulf of the Screaming Abyss, snuff these maggots with darkest night!
Tor of the Brutal Siege! Bestow your might upon me!
Your death is only the beginning!
You have failed your people!
There is a reason I am king!
Bleed no more!
What... awaits me... now?
What mongrels dare intrude here? Look alive, my brothers! A feast for the one that brings me their heads!
Sear them to the bone!
Go now! Leave nothing but ash in your wake!
Cleanse our sacred halls with flame!
You motherless knaves! Your corpses will make fine morsels for my new drake!
Not so brash now, are you?
I'll mount your skull from the highest tower!
ARGH! You call that... an attack? I'll... show... aghhhh...
Mjor na uul kval!
Are you up to the challenge? I will not hold back.
Prepare yourselves!
Hammer of the Righteous!
You... You need more practice.
Nay! Nay! And I say yet again nay! Not good enough!
I yield! I submit. Excellent work. May I run away now?
Well then, let us begin.
Thank you, good herald. Your words are too kind.
May the Light give me strength to provide a worthy challenge.
Take this time to consider your past deeds.
Take your rest.
Be at ease.
Even the darkest memory fades when confronted.
Excellent work!
You spoiled my grand entrance, rat.
Did you honestly think that an agent of the Lich King would be bested on the field of your pathetic little tournament?
I've come to finish my task.
This farce ends here!
My rotting flesh was just getting in the way!
I have no need for bones to best you!
A waste of flesh.
Pathetic.
No! I must not fail... again...
More souls to power the engine!
Finally...a captive audience!
I will sever the soul from your body!
The vortex of the harvested calls to you!
Another soul to strengthen the host!
Fodder for the engine!
My soul for you, master.
You dare look upon the host of souls?! I SHALL DEVOUR YOU WHOLE!
Stare into the abyss, and see your end!
SUFFERING! ANGUISH! CHAOS! RISE AND FEED!
Damnation!
Doomed for eternity!
The swell of souls will not be abated! You only delay the inevitable!
Rimefang! Trap them within the tunnel! Bury them alive!
Alas, brave, brave adventurers, your meddling has reached its end. Do you hear the clatter of bone and steel coming up the tunnel behind you? That is the sound of your impending demise.
Ha, such an amusing gesture from the rabble. When I have finished with you, my master's blade will feast upon your souls. Die!
I shall not fail The Lich King! Come and meet your end!
Rimefang, destroy this fool!
Power... Overwhelming...
Such a shameful display...
You are better off dead!
Perhaps you should have stayed in the mountains!
Impossible! Rimefang...Warn...-
Your pursuit shall be in vain, adventurers, for the Lich King has placed an army of undead at my command! Behold!
Persistent whelps! You will not reach the entrance of my lord's lair! Soldiers, destroy them!
Our work must not be interrupted! Ick, take care of them!
Quickly! Poison them all while they're still close!
Enough moving around! Hold still while I blow them all up!
No! That one! That one! Get that one!
I've changed my mind...go get that one instead!
What are you attacking him for? The dangerous one is over there,fool!
Ooh... We could probably use these parts!
Arms and legs are in short supply...Thanks for your contribution!
Tiny creatures under feet, you bring Garfrost something good to eat!
Axe too weak. Garfrost make better and CRUSH YOU!
Garfrost tired of puny mortals. Now your bones will freeze!
That one maybe not so good to eat now. Stupid Garfrost! BAD! BAD!
Will save for snack. For later.
Garfrost hope giant underpants clean. Save boss great shame. For later.
Your allies have arrived, Jaina, just as you promised. You will all become powerful agents of the Scourge.
There is no escape!
Death's cold embrace awaits.
Succumb to the chill of the grave.
Another dead end.
How long can you fight it?
Nowhere to run... You're mine now!
I will not make the same mistake again, Sylvanas. This time there will be no escape. You will all serve me in death!
The master surveyed his kingdom and found it... Lacking. His judgement was swift and without mercy: DEATH TO ALL!
Death is all that you will find here!
Your flesh shall decay before your very eyes!
Waste away into nothingness!
I saw the same look in his eyes when he died. Terenas could hardly believe it. Hahahaha!
Choke on your suffering!
Yes... Run... Run to meet your destiny... Its bitter, cold embrace, awaits you.
Soldiers of Lordaeron, rise to meet your master's call!
Men, women and children... None were spared the master's wrath. Your death will be no different.
Despair... so delicious...
Fear... so exhilarating...
Sniveling maggot!
The children of Stratholme fought with more ferocity!
Marwyn, finish them...
As you wish milord
I will take pity on you, Sartharion, just this once.
I fear nothing, least of all you!
You are easily bested!
Father taught me well!
On your knees!
You are insignificant!
Such mediocre resistance!
We...are superior! How could this... be...
It is amusing to watch you struggle. Very well, witness how it is done.
You have no place here. Your place is among the departed.
To darkness I condemn you..
Arrogant little creatures! To challenge powers you do not yet understand...
I am no mere dragon! You will find I am much, much, more..
No contest.
Typical... Just as I was having fun.
I should not... have held back...
Father was right about you, Sartharion... You are a weakling!
You pose no threat, lesser beings... give me your worst!
I will pick my teeth with your bones!
Aren't you tricky... I have a few tricks of my own...
Unlike you, I have many talents.
The least you could do is put up a fight...
Was that the best you can do?
I still have some... fight... in... me...
It is my charge to watch over these eggs. I will see you burn before any harm comes to them!
Burn, you miserable wretches!
Such flammable little insects...
Your charred bones will litter the floor!
How much heat can you take?
All will be reduced to ash!
Tenebron! The eggs are yours to protect as well!
Shadron! Come to me, all is at risk!
Vesperon! The clutch is in danger! Assist me!
You will make a fine meal for the hatchlings.
You are at a grave disadvantage!
This is why we call you lesser beings.
This pathetic siege ends NOW!
Such is the price... of failure...
Lesser beings, intruding here! A shame that your excess courage does not compensate for your stupidity!
None but the blue dragonflight are welcome here! Perhaps this is the work of Alexstrasza? Well then, she has sent you to your deaths!
What could you hope to accomplish? To storm brazenly into my domain... to employ magic... against ME?
I am without limits here... the rules of your cherished reality do not apply... in this realm, I am in control...
I give you one chance. Pledge fealty to me, and perhaps I won't slaughter you for your insolence!
My patience has reached its limit. I will be rid of you!
I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
Watch helplessly as your hopes are swept away...
Your stupidity has finally caught up to you!
More artifacts to confiscate...
How very... naïve...
I had hoped to end your lives quickly, but you have proven more... resilient then I anticipated. Nonetheless, your efforts are in vain. It is you reckless, careless mortals who are to blame for this war. I do what I must, and if it means your extinction.... then SO BE IT!!
Few have experienced the pain I will now inflict upon you!
YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED WHILE I DRAW BREATH!
I will teach you IGNORANT children just how little you know of magic...
Your energy will be put to good use!
I am the spell-weaver! My power is infinite!
Your spirit will linger here forever!
ENOUGH! If you intend to reclaim Azeroth's magic, then you shall have it!
Now your benefactors make their appearance...But they are too late. The powers contained here are sufficient to destroy the world ten times over! What do you think they will do to you?
SUBMIT!
The powers at work here exceed anything you could possibly imagine!
Alexstrasza! Another of your brood falls!
Little more then gnats!
Your red allies will share your fate...
Still standing? Not for long...
Your cause is lost!
Your fragile mind will be shattered!
UNTHINKABLE! The mortals will destroy... everything... my sister... what have you-
Insolent whelps! Your blood will temper the weapons used to reclaim this world!
Let the inferno consume you!
BURN! Burn in the Maker's fire!
I will burn away your impurities!
Arise, soldiers of the Iron Crucible! The Makers' will be done!
More scraps for the scrapheap!
Your bones will serve as kindling!
Let it be finished!
I. Have. Failed.
Some things are better left alone!
The secret dies with you!
There is no escape!
You waste my time!
None shall pass!
OBLIVION!
I will squeeze the life from you!
Just a scratch!
Only a flesh wound!
KOL-THARISH!
YOU FAIL!
I am invincible!
Master, they come...
New toys? For me? I promise I won't break them this time!
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
I... I think I broke it.
I guess it doesn't bend that way.
So tired. I will rest for just a moment!
I'm ready to play!
Time for a new game! My old toys will fight my new toys!
I'm tired of these toys. I don't want to play anymore!
You are bad... Toys... Very... Baaaaad!
Your destruction will herald a new age of suffering!
Behold, now! Terror, absolute!
The black blood of Yogg-Saron courses through me! I. AM. UNSTOPPABLE!
You thought to stand before the legions of death... and survive?
Defiance... a flaw of mortality.
Your defeat was inevitable!
Oh, what horrors await....
You will not defeat the Assembly of Iron so easily, invaders!
You seek the secrets of Ulduar? Then take them!
So fragile and weak!
Flesh... such a hindrance.
This meeting of the Assembly of Iron is adjourned!
My death only serves to hasten your demise.
Impossible!
Nothing short of total decimation will suffice.
Decipher this!
Face the lightning surge!
The world suffers yet another insignificant loss.
Death is the price of your arrogance.
The legacy of storms shall not be undone.
What have you gained from my defeat? You are no less doomed, mortals!
Whether the world's greatest gnats or the world's greatest heroes, you're still only mortal!
Stand still and stare into the light!
Let the storm clouds rise and rain down death from above!
A merciful kill!
HAH!
The power of the storm lives on...
You rush headlong into the maw of madness!
The Conservatory must be protected!
Elders, grant me your strength!
Eonar, your servant requires aid!
Children, assist me!
The swarm of the elements shall overtake you!
Forgive me.
From your death springs life anew!
You have strayed too far, wasted too much time!
His hold on me dissipates. I can see clearly once more. Thank you, heroes.
Eonar, your servant calls for your blessing!

Total systems failure. Defense protocols breached. Leviathan Unit shutting down.
Interlopers! You mortals who dare to interfere with my sport will pay... Wait--you...
I remember you... In the mountains... But you... what is this? Where am--
Behold the power of the storms and despair!
Do not hold back! Destroy them!
Have you begun to regret your intrusion?
Impertinent whelps! You dare challenge me atop my pedestal! I will crush you myself!
Can't you at least put up a fight!?
Pathetic!
Failures! Weaklings!
My patience has reached its limit!
Stay your arms! I yield!
I feel as though I am awakening from a nightmare, but the shadows in this place yet linger.
Sif... was Sif here? Impossible--she died by my brother's hand. A dark nightmare indeed....
I need time to reflect.... I will aid your cause if you should require it. I owe you at least that much. Farewell.
You! Fiend! You are not my beloved! Be gone!
Behold the hand behind all the evil that has befallen Ulduar! Left my kingdom in ruins, corrupted my brother and slain my wife!
And now it falls to you, champions, to avenge us all! The task before you is great, but I will lend you my aid as I am able. You must prevail!
Golganneth, lend me your strengh! Grant my mortal allies the power of thunder!
You will suffer for this trespass!
Winds of the north consume you!
Tragic. To come so far, only to fail.
Welcome to the endless winter.
Enough! This ends now!
I... I am released from his grasp... at last.
The veil of winter will protect you, champions!
The time to strike at the head of the beast will soon be upon us! Focus your anger and hatred on his minions!
Yes! YES! Show them no mercy! Give no pause to your attacks!
Let hatred and rage guide your blows!
Could they have been saved?
Powerless to act...
Weak-minded fools!
I am the lucid dream. The monster in your nightmares. The fiend of a thousand faces.Cower before my true form. BOW DOWN BEFORE THE GOD OF DEATH!
Tremble, mortals, before the coming of the end!
Suffocate upon your own hate!
Your will is no longer your own...
Destroy them minion, your master commands it!
MADNESS WILL CONSUME YOU!
Yrr n'lyeth... shuul anagg!
He will learn... no king rules forever; only death is eternal!
His brood learned their lesson before too long, you shall soon learn yours!
A thousand deaths... or one murder.
Your petty quarrels only make me stronger!
Look upon the true face of death and know that your end comes soon!
Hoohehehahahaha... AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Eternal suffering awaits!
Your fate is sealed. The end of days is finally upon you and ALL who inhabit this miserable little seedling. Uulwi ifis halahs gag erh'ongg w'ssh.
Trans-location complete. Commencing planetary analysis of Azeroth.
Stand back, mortals. I am not here to fight you.
It is in the universe's best interest to re-originate this planet should my analysis find systemic corruption. Do not interfere.
See your world through my eyes: A universe so vast as to be immeasurable - incomprehensible even to your greatest minds.
Your actions are illogical. All possible results for this encounter have been calculated. The Pantheon will receive the Observer's message regardless of outcome.
The stars come to my aid!
Witness the fury of cosmos!
Behold the tools of creation!
Beware!
Loss of life, unavoidable.
I do what I must.
You are... out of time.
Analysis complete. There is partial corruption in the planet's life-support systems as well as complete corruption in most of the planet's defense mechanisms.
Begin uplink: Reply Code: 'Omega'. Planetary re-origination requested.
Farewell, mortals. Your bravery is admirable, for such flawed creatures.
I have seen worlds bathed in the Makers' flames. Their denizens fading without so much as a whimper. Entire planetary systems born and raised in the time that it takes your mortal hearts to beat once. Yet all throughout, my own heart, devoid of emotion... of empathy. I... have... felt... NOTHING! A million, million lives wasted. Had they all held within them your tenacity? Had they all loved life as you do?
Perhaps it is your imperfection that which grants you free will. That allows you to persevere against cosmically calculated odds. You prevailed where the Titans' own perfect creations have failed.
I've rearranged the reply code. Your planet will be spared. I cannot be certain of my own calculations anymore.
I lack the strength to transmit the signal. You must hurry. Find a place of power close to the skies.
Do not worry about my fate Bronzen. If the signal is not transmitted in time re-origination will proceed regardless. Save. Your. World.
Oh, my! I wasn't expecting company! The workshop is such a mess! How embarrassing!
Now why would you go and do something like that? Didn't you see the sign that said 'DO NOT PUSH THIS BUTTON!'? How will we finish testing with the self-destruct mechanism active?
Oh, my! It would seem that we are out of time, my friends!
We haven't much time, friends! You're going to help me test out my latest and greatest creation. Now, before you change your minds, remember, that you kind of owe it to me after the mess you made with the XT-002.
MEDIC!
I can fix that... or, maybe not! Sheesh, what a mess..
WONDERFUL! Positively marvelous results! Hull integrity at 98.9 percent! Barely a dent! Moving right along.
Behold the VX-001 Anti-personnel Assault Cannon! You might want to take cover.
Fascinating. I think they call that a "clean kill". 
Note to self: Cannon highly effective against flesh.
Thank you, friends! Your efforts have yielded some fantastic data! Now, where did I put-- oh, there it is!
Isn't it beautiful? I call it the magnificent aerial command unit!
Outplayed!
You can do better than that!
Preliminary testing phase complete. Now comes the true test!!
Gaze upon its magnificence! Bask in its glorious, um, glory! I present you... V-07-TR-0N!
Prognosis: Negative!
You're not going to get up from that one, friend.
It would appear that I've made a slight miscalculation. I allowed my mind to be corrupted by the fiend in the prison, overriding my primary directive. All systems seem to be functional now. Clear.
Combat matrix enhanced. Behold wonderous rapidity!
Trifling gnome, your arrogance will be your undoing!
You face Jaraxxus, eredar lord of the Burning Legion!
FLESH FROM BONE!
Come forth, sister! Your master calls!
INFERNO!
Insignificant gnat!
Banished to the Nether!
Another will take my place. Your world is doomed.
In the name of our dark master. For the Lich King. You. Will. Die.
CHAOS!
Let the dark consume you!
Let the light consume you!
UNWORTHY!
You have been measured, and found wanting!
The Scourge cannot be stopped...
Ahhh... Our guests arrived, just as the master promised.
This place will serve as your tomb!
Auum na-l ak-k-k-k, isshhh. Rise, minions. Devour...
The swarm shall overtake you!
F-lakkh shir!
Another soul to sate the host.
I have failed you, master...
Alexstrasza has chosen capable allies... A pity that I must END YOU!
Turn them to ash, minions!
You thought you stood a chance?
It's for the best.
HALION! I...
Meddlesome insects! You're too late: The Ruby Sanctum's lost.
Your world teeters on the brink of annihilation. You will ALL bear witness to the coming of a new age of DESTRUCTION!
The heavens burn!
You will find only suffering within the realm of twilight! Enter if you dare!
Beware the shadow!
I am the light and the darkness! Cower, mortals, before the herald of Deathwing!
Not good enough.
Another "hero" falls.
Relish this victory, mortals, for it will be your last! This world will burn with the master's return!
Hahahaha!
You will sssuffer for this intrusion!
Burn in the master's flame!
Halion will be pleased.
As it should be...
Your power wanes, ancient one.... Soon you will join your friends.
Ah, the entertainment has arrived.
Twice the pain and half the fun.
This world has enough heroes.
Baltharus leaves no survivors!
I... Didn't see that coming...
You have made an... unwise... decision.
Just a taste...
Know my hunger!
SUFFER!
Can you handle this?
Yes... feed my precious one! You're mine now!
Really, is that all you got?
Here it comes.
THIS ENDS NOW!
But... we were getting along... so well...
How...unfortunate.
Such a pity.
Heroes, lend me your aid! I... I cannot hold them off much longer! You must heal my wounds!
I have opened a portal into the Dream. Your salvation lies within, heroes.
My strength is returning! Press on, heroes!
I will not last much longer!
Forgive me for what I do! I... cannot... stop... ONLY NIGHTMARES REMAIN!
A tragic loss...
FAILURES!
I am renewed! Ysera grants me the favor to lay these foul creatures to rest!
So...the Light's vaunted justice has finally arrived. Shall I lay down Frostmourne and throw myself at your mercy, Fordring?
You will learn of that first hand. When my work is complete, you will beg for mercy -- and I will deny you. Your anguished cries will be testament to my unbridled power.
I'll keep you alive to witness the end, Fordring. I would not want the Light's greatest champion to miss seeing this wretched world remade in my image.
Come then champions, feed me your rage!
I will freeze you from within until all that remains is an icy husk!
Watch as the world around you collapses!
Val'kyr, your master calls!
Frostmourne hungers...
Argh... Frostmourne, obey me!
Frostmourne feeds on the soul of your fallen ally!
Apocalypse!
Bow down before your lord and master!
Hope wanes!
The end has come!
Face now your tragic end!
No questions remain unanswered. No doubts linger. You ARE Azeroth's greatest champions. You overcame every challenge I laid before you. My mightiest servants have fallen before your relentless onslaught... your unbridled fury...
You trained them well, Fordring. You delivered the greatest fighting force this world has ever known... right into my hands -- exactly as I intended. You shall be rewarded for your unwitting sacrifice.
Watch now as I raise them from the dead to become masters of the Scourge. They will shroud this world in chaos and destruction. Azeroth's fall will come at their hands -- and you will be the first to die.
I delight in the irony.
Impossible...
Now I stand, the lion before the lambs... and they do not fear. They cannot fear.
Good news, everyone! I think I perfected a plague that will destroy all life on Azeroth!
You can't come in here all dirty like that! You need that nasty flesh scrubbed off first!
Two oozes, one room! So many delightful possibilities...
Hmm. I don't feel a thing. Whaa...? Where'd those come from?
Tastes like... Cherry! Oh! Excuse me!
Hmm... Interesting...
That was unexpected!
Great news, everyone!
Bad news, everyone! I don't think I'm going to make it.
For every Horde soldier that you killed -- for every Alliance dog that fell, the Lich King's armies grew. Even now the val'kyr work to raise your fallen as Scourge.
Things are about to get much worse. Come, taste the power that the Lich King has bestowed upon me!
Dwarves...
Join me, father. Join me and we will crush this world in the name of the Scourge -- for the glory of the Lich King!
Stubborn and old. What chance do you have? I am stronger, and more powerful than you ever were.
Pathetic old orc. Come then heroes. Come and face the might of the Scourge!
BY THE MIGHT OF THE LICH KING!
The ground runs red with your blood!
Feast, my minions!
You are nothing!
Your soul will find no redemption here!
I have become...DEATH!
I... Am... Released.
NOOOO! You kill Stinky! You pay!
Fun time!
Gyah! Uhhh, I not feel so good...
Daddy, I did it!
Dead, dead, dead!
Fun time over!
Da ... Ddy...
Just an ordinary gas cloud. But watch out, because that's no ordinary gas cloud!
Oh, Festergut. You were always my favorite. Next to Rotface. The good news is you left behind so much gas, I can practically taste it!
This is the beginning AND the end, mortals. None may enter the master's sanctum!
The Scourge will wash over this world as a swarm of death and destruction!
BONE STORM!
Bound by bone!
Stick Around!
The only escape is death!
More bones for the offering!
Languish in damnation!
THE MASTER'S RAGE COURSES THROUGH ME!
I see... only darkness...
Foolish mortals. You thought us defeated so easily? The San'layn are the Lich King's immortal soldiers! Now you shall face their might combined!
Rise up, brothers, and destroy our enemies.
Such wondrous power! The Darkfallen Orb has made me INVINCIBLE!
Blood will flow!
Were you ever a threat?
Truth is found in death.
My queen... they come...
Tremble before Taldaram, mortals, for the power of the orb flows through me!
Delight in the pain!
Worm food.
Beg for mercy!
Naxxanar was merely a setback! With the power of the orb, Valanar will have his vengeance!
My cup runneth over.
Dinner... is served.
Do you see NOW the power of the Darkfallen?
BOW DOWN BEFORE THE SAN'LAYN!
...why...?
What? Precious? Noooooooooo!!!
WEEEEEE!
Icky sticky.
I think I made an angry poo-poo. It gonna blow!
Daddy make toys out of you!
I brokes-ded it...
Sleepy Time!
Bad news daddy.
Great news, everyone! The slime is flowing again!
Good news, everyone! I've fixed the poison slime pipes!
Terrible news, everyone, Rotface is dead! But great news everyone, he left behind plenty of ooze for me to use! Whaa...? I'm a poet, and I didn't know it? Astounding!
You are fools to have come to this place! The icy winds of Northrend will consume your souls!
Suffer, mortals, as your pathetic magic betrays you!
Can you feel the cold hand of death upon your heart?
Aaah! It burns! What sorcery is this?!
Your incursion ends here! None shall survive!
Now feel my master's limitless power and despair!
Perish!
A flaw of mortality...
Enough! I tire of these games!
Free...at last...
You have found your way here, because you are among the few gifted with true vision in a world cursed with blindness.
You can see through the fog that hangs over this world like a shroud, and grasp where true power lies.
Fix your eyes upon your crude hands: the sinew, the soft meat, the dark blood coursing within. It is a weakness; a crippling flaw.... A joke played by the Creators upon their own creations.
The sooner you come to accept your condition as a defect, the sooner you will find yourselves in a position to transcend it.
Through our Master, all things are possible. His power is without limit, and his will unbending.
Those who oppose him will be destroyed utterly, and those who serve -- who serve wholly, unquestioningly, with utter devotion of mind and soul -- elevated to heights beyond your ken.
What is this disturbance?! You dare trespass upon this hallowed ground? This shall be your final resting place.
Enough! I see I must take matters into my own hands!
You are weak, powerless to resist my will!
Take this blessing and show these intruders a taste of our master's power.
I release you from the curse of flesh!
Arise and exult in your pure form!
Do you yet grasp of the futility of your actions?
Embrace the darkness... Darkness eternal!
This charade has gone on long enough.
All part of the masters plan! Your end is... inevitable!
A new host must be found.
There is only Ghur'sha.
Who are your allies?
Give in.
Is. This. Reality.
Too weak to serve!
Only your memory remains!
They are outside the cycle...
Ahh - my fearless assistants, I assume.
You may yet regret your presence here.
As I purify these waters, the servants of filth will surely be stirred. Beware!
Patience guests. The waters are nearly cleansed.
The beast has returned! It must not pollute my waters!
Augh... Their filthiness stains me!
My waters are cleansed! Drink in their power!
Behold the power of pure water!
I grow weary!
Fools! Make yourselves useful!
Your kind... cannot be... trusted...
You are unworthy of my domain!
My attention was wasted on you!
You have interfered with our plans for the last time, mortals.
Armies of the depths, wash over our enemies as a tide of death!
Meddlesome gnats, you've thought us defeated so easily.
Take arms, minions! Rise from the icy depths!
Destroy these intruders! Leave them for the great dark beyond!
The abyss awaits!
Depths take you!
Ulthok... stop them...
Where one falls, many shall take its place...
They do not die.
Boss Cho'gall not gonna be happy 'bout dis!
Stand still! Rom'ogg crack your skulls!
That what you get! Nothing!
Rom'ogg...sorry...
Bodies to test my armaments upon!
Feel the burn!
Merely an impurity in the compound!
We number in the millions! Your efforts are wasted...
HERETICS! You will suffer for this interruption!
Bask in his power! Rise as an agent of the master's rage!
There is only one true path of enlightenment! DEATH!
For the master I die a thousand times... A thousan...
You come seeking answers? Then have them! Look upon your answer to living!
Your kind has no place in the master's world!
Earth can be shaped, molded... You cannot! You are useless!
I cannot be destroyed... Only de... layed...
The world will be reborn in flames!
Witness the power bestowed upon me by Deathwing! Feel the fury of earth!
A sacrifice for you, master.
For my death, countless more will fall. The burden is now yours to bear.
None may pass into the World's Heart!
Break yourselves upon my body. Feel the strength of the earth!
The cycle is complete.
A protector has fallen. The World's Heart lies exposed!
Filthy Beasts! Your presence in Skywall will not be tolerated
AHHHHHHHHH!
RAVAGED!
YOU tread upon the sacrosanct! Mortals have no place amidst the clouds.
Al'Akir, your servant calls for aid!
BACK to the earth with you!
The winds take me!
Begone infidels, you are not welcome here!
Kneel before me and repent!
Death is only the beginning!
May peace find you now.
The Heavens take you!
Winds of the south, rise and come to your master's aid!
Cower before the tempest storm!
Nothing more than dust in the wind.
The sky... Beckons...
I. AM. UNLEASHED!
Your city will be buried. Your lives forfeit to the elements!
Suffer the storm!
Bwaaaah! You no take da treasure!!!
Bwagauugh!!! Augh feed you to da crocs!
Gwaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!
GAAAH! How you kill crocs?!
Augh smart! Augh already steal treasure while you no looking!
Invaders! You shall go no further!
Murkash!
Siamat must not be freed! Turn back before it is too late!
Tread Lightly!
Insolent rat!
Defilers! Wretches! Fiends! Begone from here!
Can you feel it? The blessed warmth of the sun?
I send you to your deity.
I will take this life as an offering!
Blazing rays of light, take me!
This chamber will flourish with your life energy!
Your life, UNLEASHED!
The cycle continues...
Wither away!
Waste of energy!
More carrion for the swarm...
Dust to dust...
HYAAAH!
Ptah... is... no more...
This unit has been activated outside normal operating protocols. Downloading new operational parameters. Download complete. Full unit self defense routines are now active. Destruction of foreign units in this system shall now commence.
Purge of unauthorized entities commencing.
Purge Complete.
Target Annihilated.
Omega Stance activated. Annihilation of foreign unit is now imminent.
Anraphet unit shutting down...
Alpha beams activated. Target tracking commencing.
You fear that which you cannot control. But can you control your fear?
Do you understand now?
Yes! Harness... your... hatred.
Embrace the end.
Gaze to the heavens! What do you see?
Bask in my radiance!
Insignificant!
The glimmer of your life, extinguished.
Eons of darkness...by your hand.
My luster...wanes.
Turn back, intruders! These halls must not be disturbed!
Beacons of light, bestow upon me your aegis!
What... have you... done?
I regret nothing!
A product of your own insolence!
Cover the rear! Alexstraza's brood decimate our rank!
Reinforce the front! We are being invaded!
A million more await my orders. What chance you do have?
Attack you cowardly vermin!
Messy...
Vermin, your dinner awaits!
The darkest days are still ahead!
Come, suffering... Enter, chaos!
F'lakh ghet! The shadow's hunger cannot be sated!
Flesh for the offering!
Ywaq maq oou; ywaq maq ssaggh. Yawq ma shg'fhn.
NO! Throngus get whipped again if he no finish!
Oh, this is gonna HURT!
You not get through defenses!
Throngus SLICE you up!
You break easy!
Throngus use your corpse on body. Somewhere...
Death... Good choice. Not best choice maybe, but better than fail and live.
I will burn you from the inside out!
INCINERATE THEM, MINIONS!
BY FIRE BE... BURNED!
Dragon, you will do as I command! Catch me!
You should have come better prepared!
Valiona, finish them! Avenge me!
If they do not kill you, I will do it myself!
I will not die for you, Drahga.
An easy kill!
You! Are you the ones responsible for what has happened here...?
What dark horrors have you wrought in this place? By my ancestors' honor, I shall take you to task!
There will be no escape!
My wrath knows no bounds!
Suffer for your arrogance!
This is the price you pay!
A just punishment.
Where... is this place? What... have I done? Forgive me, my father...
Another band of Deathwing's converts? I'll be sure your death is especially painful.
And so ends your story.
Cry havoc!
Watch, heathens, as death surrounds you!
This ... isn't how it's supposed to ... end.
There is nothing left for you here, nothing but death and sorrow.
Elune guide you through the night.
Give yourselves to the night, Elune will guide you from this mortal prison.
Let the peaceful light of Elune soothe your souls in this dark time.
The darkness surrounds you, the light of Elune is your only salvation.
The moonlight can bring rest to your weary souls in this forgotten place.
You have chosen a path of darkness. Mother moon, guide my hand; allow me to bring rest to these misbegotten souls.
Eyes of night, pierce this darkness!
Spear of Elune, drive back the night!
Moon goddess, your light dims! I am lost without your guidance!
The darkness closes in...my vision is clouded...
Mother moon, I can no longer see your light! Your daughter is alone in the darkness!
I can...see the light of the moon...so clearly now. It is...beautiful...
I don't know who you are, but I'll defend this shrine with my life. Leave, now, before we come to blows
A little ice ought to quench the fire in your hearts...
I didn't want to do that.
I hate resorting to violence.
I wish you'd surrendered.
Perhaps this will cool your heads...
Why won't you give up?!
You asked for it.
You forced my hand.
I understand, now. Farewell, and good luck.
The "End Time," I once called this place. I had not seen, by then; I did not know. You hope to... what? Stop me, here? Change the fate I worked so tirelessly to weave?
You crawl unwitting, like a blind, writhing worm, towards endless madness and despair. I have witnessed the true End Time. This? This is a blessing you simply cannot comprehend.
So be it.
The powers of the Hourglass do nothing to me!
To repeat the same action and expect different results is madness.
Another chance will make no difference. You will fail.
Again...? Is this your plot, your scheme?
The Hourglass' power is exhausted. No more games, mortals. Relent, or perish.
The sand has run out.
Time ends.
Your time has come.
You know not what you have done. Aman'Thul... What I... have... seen...
Ah, welcome. You are here to join us in the coming celebration? No? A pity.
I have no time for such diversions. Keepers of Eternity, will you stand for your queen?
Still these strangers would oppose your queen's will. Who will stop them?
I beseech of you, my beloved subjects: Put an end to these miscreants.
If you intend to play the fool, you may as well look the part.
Dance for the Eternal Court.
Serve Azshara, puppets, and rejoice.
Bold of you, to strike a queen. A lesser monarch might be enraged.
Do not ask for mercy after such an act.
Such insolence! My temper grows short.
Unfortunate, but deserved.
I am unimpressed.
Your conduct was inexcusable.
To prepare for a world of perfection, the imperfect must be swept away.
Enough! As much as I adore playing hostess, I have more pressing matters to attend to.
Riders, to me!
My noble Varo'then, do return and dispose of this murderous band.
He is near, lurking in the shadows... I can sense it.
You, Felguard. Hold this area.
The rest of you, secure the courtyard.
Who shut down the portals!? Clever. Little worms.
None will reach the palace without besting Peroth'arn...first of the feltouched.
No mortal may stand before me and live!
Your essence is MINE!
The shadows serve me now!
The shadows will not save you!
I WILL find you!
Cower in hiding.
I can see you!
You hide well, worms. But how long can you delay your doom?
ENOUGH! It is time to end this game!
You lose! Hah!
None compare to Peroth'arn.
Noooo! How could this be?
Varo'then, see that I am not disrupted by this rabble.
Highguard, to arms! For your Queen! For Azshara!
For you, Azshara!
Come, Stormrage, and I will show you what happens to those that betray the lord of the Legion!
Amanare maev il azgalada zila ashj ashj zila enkil!
None may cross the queen!
A deserved death!
In Azshara's name!
Fall and die before me!
Squirm...Scream. Hahahaha!
Useless!
Your blood is MINE, elf!
Lights of lights! I have failed you. I am sorry, my Azshara...
Rrraaaghhh!
Lord Sargeras, I will not fail you! Sweep your molten fist through this world so that it may be reborn in flames and darkness!
Yes... yes! I can feel his burning eyes upon me, he is close...so close. And then your world will be unmade, your lives as nothing!
No... no! This victory will not be ripped from my grasp! I will not return to him in failure! I will not be torn from this pitiful world! No... NOOOOOOOO!!
Shaman! The Dragon Soul is not yours. Give it up, and you may yet walk away with your life.
Destroy them all, but bring the Shaman to me!
You will go nowhere, Shaman.
You are a fool if you think to take your place as the Aspect of Earth, Shaman!
You're a mere mortal. It is time you die like one.
Give up the Dragon Soul, and I may yet allow you to live.
Enough, shaman!
None will survive!
The Shaman is mine, focus on his companions!
Freeze!
Mere mortals...
Your shaman can't protect you.
The Aspects misplaced their trust.
The Hour of Twilight falls - the end of all things - you cannot stop it. You are nothing. NOTHING!
Nothing! Nothing...
Where do you think you're going, little lizard?
...and with that out of the way, you and your flock of fumbling friends are next on my list. Mmm, I thought you'd never get here!
Let's get to work, shall we?
Bye-bye.
Now you see me...
Surprise.
So soon.
I hope your friends can do better!
Too much fun!
Good night.
Well, that was even easier than I thought.
You're much... better... than I thought...
Get inside! Quickly! I'll hold them off.
And now, Shaman, you will give the Dragon Soul to me.
I suppose it has to be this way, then. If only you'd seen what I've seen. THEN you'd understand.
There is no good. No evil. No Light. There is only POWER!
We serve this world's TRUE masters! When their rule begins, we will share in their glory!
And YOU! We will FEAST on your ashes! Now, DIE!
The light will consume you!
Witness my POWER!
Drown in Shadow!
Light be with you.
May your faith guide you.
I looked into the eyes of The Dragon, and despaired...
How I HATE this place. My captors may be long-dead, but don't think I won't take it all out on you miserable treasure-hunters.
I hate adventurers.
I hate armor.
I hate martyrs.
Feel my hatred!
My hatred burns!
My hate will consume you!
I hate you all!
I hate standing still.
I still hate you.
Do you hate me? Good.
I hate mercy.
I didn't hate that.
I hate incompetent raiders.
I hate... every one of you...
Valiona, Theralion, put them in their place.
Do as the master commands, Theralion! Kill them!
The master was clearly speaking to you, Valiona. I am far too busy to attack ANYONE.
You are worthless, Theralion!
How dare you call me worthless! You will see why I am Mother's favored child!
You are not the boss of me Valiona! I will engulf as I please!
There is no escape from the fury of the Twilight Flight!
Bare your soul to me, mortal.
Writhe in AGONY!
I knew I should have stayed out of this...
Enter TWILIGHT!
Theralion! I will engulf the Hallway! Cover their escape!
Breathe your dying breath!
At least Theralion dies with me...
Come closer, closer. Let us see your faces. All will be humbled before his power.
We were fools to entrust an imbecile like Cho'gall with such a sacred duty. I will deal with you intruders myself!
Feed, children! Take your fill from their meaty husks!
The energy infuse within my clutch is mine to reclaim!
SUFFER!
FEEL MY HATRED!
I tire of this. Do you see this clutch amidst which you stand? I have nurtured the spark within them, but that life-force is and always will be mine. Behold, power beyond your comprehension!
Heroes! You are not alone in this dark place!
Sintharia! Your master owes me a great debt... one that I intend to extract from his consort's hide!
This will be your tomb as well as theirs!
Flame of life, burn within me and renew my vigor!
You are weakening, Sintharia! Accept the inevitable!
You mistake this for weakness? Fool!
Heroes! My power wanes....
My brood will feast upon your essence!
All is lost.... Forgive me, my Queen....
Enough! Drawing upon this source will set us back months. You should feel honored to be worthy of its expenditure. Now... die!
The fires dim, champions.... Take this, the last of my power. Succeed where I have failed. Avenge me. Avenge the world....
My brood will feed on your bones!
Powerless...
Deathwing! I have fallen.... The brood... is lost.
Brothers of Twilight! The Hammer calls to you! Fire water earth air. Leave your mortal shell behind. Fire water earth air. Embrace your new forms for here and everafter! Burn and drown and crush and suffocate. And use your gifts to destroy the unbelievers. Burn and drown and crush and suffocate!!
You dare invade our lord's sanctum?
You will die for your insolence!
Enough of this foolishness!
We will handle them!
An impressive display... To have made it this far. But now witness true power... The fury of the elements!
BEHOLD YOUR DOOM!
I will freeze the blood in your veins!
Perish!
BURN!
More fuel for the fire!
Wind, hear my call!
Merely a whisper in the wind...
The earth will devour you!
The soil welcomes your bones!
FEEL THE POWER!
Annihilate....
Eradicate....
Impossible....
(Usurper's children!) Nothing you have done - (SPAWN OF A LESSER GOD!) I am trying to speak here! (Words, words, words! The Master wants MURDER!) All falls to chaos. ALL will be destroyed. (Chaos, chaos!) Your work here today changes nothing. (Chaos, chaos, all things END!) No mortal may see what you have and live. Your end has come.
Enough! (To His will all flesh succumbs. From His kingdom, chaos comes!) Yes - what he said.
Give me your strength!
Behold the might of the Hammer!
Everyone succumbs in the end!
(Stop. Hammertime!)
Behold the destiny of your fragile world!
(Come brothers! Feast on hope!)
More, more! (More! They need more!)
(Infinite suffering!)
Brother... it cannot be... (Destiny has come!) My strength... (Too proud! He speaks in blood! Listen!) My mind... (It is for His glory we serve!) What... is happening...? (Gone is the dawn. Come shades of twilight! Come madness! Come Havoc! Come infinite night!)
(The claws of fate grasp the unbelievers!!)
What madness have we wrought... (Not yet enough!)
I... can't take much more... (Brother, it merely begins!!)
(The Master sees, the Master SEES!)
(The Master's eye sees all that was and all to be, or not!)
(NOW they see the darkness! Their eyes are open!!)
(Body and soul, to be swallowed whole!)
Now The Master has them!
(Chaos! Madness! Like a hug for your brain!!)
(Finish it! Finish them all!)
(Blood for The Master!)
Embrace your end.
It is finished. (The fate of all!)
Brother... we are shattered... (But The Master... I still hear... so angry... Master...)
Brother... we are shattered... let her... finish them... (The Master... does not want them near her... Brother... The Master seethes...)
Cho'gall will have your heads! ALL OF THEM!
Halfus! Hear me! The Master calls, the Master wants Protect our secrets, Halfus. Destroy the intruders. Murder for His glory. Murder for His hunger.
The burden of the damned falls upon you!
The wyrms will eat well tonight!
Flesh and sinew, weak but proud. Dare they part the Master's shroud? They stumble fumble groping blind, Finding fate and chaos intertwined.
It shall be I that earns the favor of our lord by casting out the intruders. My calmest wind shall prove too much for them!
Begone, outsiders!
Your presence shall no longer defile our home!
The power of our winds, UNLEASHED!
My power grows feeble, brothers. I shamefully must rely on you for a time.
You think to outrun the wind? A fatal mistake.
As I am the strongest wind, it shall be I that tears the invaders apart!
The intruders stand fast, brothers. I cannot break them. Allow me a brief respite to strengthen my winds.
Blown away!
Mere dust...
Why do you flee, mortals? There is nowhere you can run or hide here!
The honor of slaying the interlopers shall be mine, brothers! Their feeble bodies will freeze solid from my wind's icy chill!
Frozen solid.
Another mortal has taken their last breath!
You throw away your honor and flee as cowards? Then die!
Brothers, beware! These mortals are dangerous. I must pause and gather my strength.
This confrontation no longer serves any purpose. I shall end it.
The Conclave of Wind has dissipated. Your honorable conduct and determination have earned you the right to face me in battle, mortals. I await your assault on my platform! Come!
Your challenge is accepted, mortals! Know that you face Al'Akir, Elemental Lord of Air! You have no hope of defeating me!
Winds! Obey my command!
Your futile persistence angers me.
Storms! I summon you to my side!
ENOUGH! I WILL NO LONGER BE CONTAINED!
Like swatting insects...
This little one will vex me no longer.
After every storm... comes the calm...
There can be no disruptions! Mustn't keep the master waiting, mustn't fail again!
Mix and stir! Apply heat!
How well does the mortal shell handle extreme temperature change? Must find out! For Science!
This one's a little unstable! But what's progress without failure?
What they lack in intelligence they make up for in ferocity!
My failings will be your downfall!
Your mixtures are weak, Maloriak! They need a bit more... kick!
When pushed to the edge, results may become unpredictable!
Too early, but no choice... They must be tested! Face now my prime subjects!
Meet the brawn to my brains! Prime subjects, devour them!
Nothing goes to waste!
Strip the flesh, harvest the organs!
There will never be another like me...
We never did see eye to eye... Good riddance I say!
Congratulations! Allow me to grant you a title befitting the amazing achievement you just performed! Henceforth, you shall be known as the Slayer of Stupid, Incompetent and Disappointing Minions!
Finally someone to deal with that unsightly pest! You have my thanks, "heroes."
I found this fascinating specimen in the lava underneath this very room. Magmaw should provide an adequate challenge for your pathetic little band.
On second thought, what fun is an "adequate" challenge?
Inconceivable! You may actually defeat my lava worm! Perhaps I can help... tip the scales.
You won? How... disappointing. I could have easily watched you all continue to stand in the fire.
Ah, Chimaeron, truly a living testament to my scientific prowess. I reworked and twisted his form countless times over the years, and the final result is truly something to behold.
Poor little fella.
Oh, you were expecting something else to happen just then, weren't you? Let's see how you adapt after a new set of adjustments, shall we?
This fight has gotten a bit stale; allow me to spice things up!
Stop fighting yourself this instant, Chimaeron!
Impressive! You managed to destroy one of my most horrific creations - a task I'd thought impossible until now.
Hmm... A shame to lose that experiment.
Great job guys! The key should be in his guts somewhere. Just, uh, fish around in there 'till you find it.
Arcanitron unit activated.
Electron unit activated.
Magmatron unit activated.
Toxitron unit activated.
Intruders detected. Primary defense matrix initiated.
Hmm... the Omnotron Defense System. Centuries ago these constructs were considered the Dwarves' greatest tactical achievements. With so many counters to each construct's attacks, I'll have to rectify these designs for them to provide me any entertainment.
Arcanotron unit shield systems online.
Electron unit shield systems online.
Magmatron unit shield systems online.
Toxitron unit shield systems online.
Rerouting excess energy to Magmatron unit. Engage flamethrower device.
You would like to move away from that, wouldn't you? Too bad.
Stupid Dwarves and your fascination with runes! Why would you create something that would help your enemy?
Lightning Conductor works much better in a crowd, yes?
Were you planing on using Toxitron's chemicals to damage the other constructs? Clever plan, let me ruin that for you.
Defense systems obliterated. Powering down...
That malfunctioning piece of junk was murder on the repair bills.
I should've known better than to rely on something so stupidly named... to entertain me for long.
Welcome to my personal sanctum heroes! I hope you find the accomodations to your liking. Within you will find many of my failed experiments and... ultimately... my greatest triumph!
Mortals that fancy themselves HEROES have entered the Broken Hall! Oh, I do hope this 'raid' will amuse me more than the last!
Ha ha ha ha ha! The heroes have made it to the glorious finale! I take it you are in good spirits? Prepared for the final battle? Then gaze now upon my ultimate creation! RISE, SISTER!
Behold, the Broodmother... Onyxia... REBORN. Perhaps my finest work.
My dearest sibling... do you hunger? THEN FEAST UPON OUR ENEMIES!
See how the shadowflame animates the bones? They fight at my command!
Curse you, mortals! Such a callous disregard for one's possessions must be met with extreme force!
I have tried to be an accommodating host, but you simply will not die! Time to throw all pretense aside and just... KILL YOU ALL!
Flesh turns to ash!
Mortal minds... So easily manipulated.
I hope you can swim... in molten lava!
HAH!
It has been a pleasure!
You really have to want it!
I thank you for coming, but you really all must die now!
Defeat has never tasted so bitter...
I have no need for eyes to see my enemies. Your clumsy footsteps and foul stench give you away!
Atramedes, are you going deaf as well as blind? Hurry up and kill them all.
These shields are proving quite the nuisance.
Atramedes, the heroes are right THERE!
You cannot hide from Searing Flame!
Yes, run! With every step your heartbeat quickens. The beating... loud and thunderous, almost deafening! You cannot escape!
Sighted, but blind to the truth. Embrace the finality of it all!
Death waits in the darkness!
This miserable existence finally ends.
Now that was really unnecessary.
You should've been disposed of a long time ago.
You are forbidden from my master's domain, mortals.
Fool mortals. Hurl yourselves into your own demise!
Burn beneath my molten fury!
By the Firelord's command, you, too, shall perish!
Your flesh is forfeit to the fires of this realm.
You have been judged.
Behold your weakness.
None shall pass!
Mortal filth... the master's keep is forbidden...
What have we here - visitors to our kingdom in the Firelands?
You mortals may remember Alysra, who spirited me to freedom in Mount Hyjal. She, too has been reborn. Born of flame!
I wish I could watch her reduce your pitiful band to cinders, but I am needed elsewhere. Farewell!
I serve a new master now, mortals!
Behold His power!
Let the unbelievers perish in fire!
We call upon you, Firelord!
Witness his majesty of flame!
These skies are MINE!
I will burn you from the sky!
Fire... fire...
Together we call upon the lord of fire!
Reborn in flame!
BURN!
For his Glory!
The light... mustn't... burn out...
Mortal insects! You dare trespass into MY domain? Your arrogance will be purged in living flame.
Begone from my realm, insects.
The realm of fire will consume you!
Be consumed by flame!
Deathwing has prepared me to face the vessel of Tarecgosa, your fools journey ends here!
Minions of fire, purge the outsiders!
Denizens of flame, come to me!
Arise, servants of fire! Consume their flesh!
Enough! I will finish this!
Fall to your knees, mortals! This ends now!
Sulfuras will be your end!
You will be crushed!
Die!
Your judgement has come!
Pathetic!
This is my realm!
Too soon! ... You have come too soon...
Too soon...
Arrggh, outsiders - this is not your realm!
When I finish this, your pathetic mortal world will burn with my vengeance!
No, noooo- This was to be my hour of triumph..
Yes... I smell them too, Riplimb. Outsiders encroach on the Firelord's private grounds. Find their trail, find them for me, that I may dispense punishment!
Aha! The interlopers... Kill them! EAT THEM!
Now you BURN!!
Twist in flames, interlopers!
Go for the throat!
KILL!
Tear them down!
Sic 'em!
Fetch your supper!
Yes... oh yes!
The Firelord will be most pleased!
Now you stay dead!
Dog food!
Step off!
Back! Stay back!
Get away from me, outsiders!
Back, filth!
You murderers! Why... why would you kill such a noble animal?!
Riplimb! No... no! Oh, you terrible little beasts! HOW COULD YOU?!
The pain... Lord of fire, it hurts...
Hah? Hruumph? Soft little fleshy-things? Here? Nuisances, nuisances!
So soft!
Finished.
Squeak, little pest.
I'll crush you underfoot!
Stomp now.
Buuurrrnn!
Succumb to living flame.
My inner fire can never die!
Consuuuuuuume!
Flesh, buuurrrns.
Augh - smooshy little pests, look what you've done!
Graaahh!
Oh you little beasts...
Oww now hey.
Uurrghh now you... you infuriate me!
Eons I have slept undisturbed... Now this... Creatures of flesh, now you will BURN!
Broken. Mnngghhh... broken...
Well well... I admire your tenacity. Baleroc stood guard over this keep for a thousand mortal lifetimes.
But NONE may enter the Firelord's abode!
Beg for mercy now, and I may yet allow you to live. Well, "heroes", what is your answer?
Very well. Witness the raw power of my new lord!
The master's power takes on many forms...
Behold the rage of the Firelands!
Blaze of Glory!
Nothing but ash!
Burn.
Soon, ALL of Azeroth will burn!
So much power!
You stood in the fire!
My studies... had only just begun...
I am the beginning of the end...the shadow which blots out the sun...the bell which tolls your doom..
For this moment ALONE was I made. Look upon your death, mortals, and despair!
Now is the Hour of Twilight!
The final shred of light fades, and with it, your pitiful mortal existence!
Through the pain and fire my hatred burns!
Fall before Ultraxion!
You have no hope!
Hahahahaha
I WILL DRAG YOU WITH ME INTO FLAME AND DARKNESS!
But...but...I am...Ul...trax...ionnnnnn...
You have done NOTHING. I will tear your world APART.
There's no shelter from my fury!
Your armor means nothing! Your faith - even less!
The sea will swallow your smoldering remains!
I SHALL TEAR THIS WORLD APART!
I SHALL SHOW YOU A TRUE CATACLYSM!
WATCH AS YOUR WORLD COMES TO AN END!
I AM DEATHWING! THE DESTROYER! THE END OF ALL THINGS! INEVITABLE! INDOMITABLE! I AM THE CATACLYSM!
There is no hope, no future, all life is doomed!
Like you, all Azeroth shall burn!
Know that your world will soon follow!
Hah! I was hoping you'd make it this far. You'd best be ready for a real fight.
You won't get near the Master. Dragonriders, attack!
Goriona! Give them hell!
Looks like I'm doing this myself. Good!
How's THIS?
Come on!
We're flying a little too close. It's been a good fight, but I'm ending it, now.
Mess with the bull....
Down you go!
Get up! Oh... weakling!
Well...done, heh. But I wonder if you're good enough...to best him.
Your tenacity is admirable, but pointless! You ride into the jaws of the apocalypse!
You are less than dust, fit only to be brushed from my back.
Ha! I didn't realize you fools were still there.
Your efforts are insignificant! I carry you to your deaths!
Cling while you can, heroes! You and your world are doomed!
Heh! Even with the aspect of time on your side, you stumble foolishly into a trap.
Don't preen just yet little pups, we'll cleanse this world of your kind.
Heh! You won't leave this place alive.
Not one of you will live to see the final Cataclysm! Finish them!
Swagger all you like; you pups don't stand a chance. Flee now, while you can.
You cross the Stormbinder! I'll slaughter you all.
You face more than my axes, this close.
See what becomes of those who stand before me!
Feel a chill up your spine...?
Stay, pup.
Hold still.
You can't outrun the storm.
Die beneath the ice.
The time I spent binding that, WASTED!
You'll PAY for that.
Enough!
Again?!
Impudent pup!
The one remaining is still enough to finish you.
Suffer the storm's wrath!
Thunder and lightning dance at my call!
What are you doing?
You're toying with death.
You think you can play with my lightning?
No! More... lightning...
Enough of your games! You won't live to do it again.
I'll finish you now pups!
Aughhhh!
Impossible!
You should have run, dog!
Feh!
Down, pup.
A waste of my time.
Cowards! You pack of weakling...dogs...
Our numbers are endless, our power beyond reckoning! All who oppose the Destroyer will DIE A THOUSAND DEATHS!
You will drown in the blood of the Old Gods! ALL OF YOU!
SEE how we pour from the CURSED EARTH!
The DARKNESS devours ALL!
Your soul will know ENDLESS TORMENT!
All praise Deathwing, THE DESTROYER!
From its BLEAKEST DEPTHS, we RECLAIM this world!
O, Deathwing! Your faithful servant has failed you!
No mortal shall turn me from my task!
Cowards! Weaklings! Come down and fight or I will bring you down!
You cannot hide in this temple forever, shaman! Wyrmrest will fall. All will be dust.
I will turn this tower to rubble and scatter it across the wastes.
You seek to halt an avalanche. I will bury you.
Flee and die!
Run, and perish.
The stone calls...and the black blood of the earth consumes you.
The ground shakes...and there is no escape from the old gods.
The rocks tremble...and the rage of the true gods follows.
The surface quakes...and you drown in the hate of The Master.
You thought to fight me alone? The earth splits to swallow and crush you.
I am unstoppable.
It was inevitable.
Ground to dust.
Impossible. This cannot be. The tower...must...fall.
Once more shall the twisted flesh-banners of N'Zoth chitter and howl above the fly-blown corpse of this world. After millennia, we have returned.
Victory for Deathwing. For the glory of N'Zoth!
Your fear drives me.
Your suffering strengthens me.
Your agony sustains me.
The will of N'Zoth corrupts you.
Gaze into the heart of N'Zoth.
Your skulls shall adorn N'Zoth's writhing throne.
Your deaths shall sing of N'Zoth's unending glory.
Your souls shall sate N'Zoth's endless hunger.
To have waited so long... for this...
Did you hear something lads?
Ah, fresh meat for the dogs.
Attack! Kill them all!
Release the hounds!
Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
Pierce the flesh!
Blades, cut them to pieces!
Blood, blow around me!
Don't just sit there! Kill them!
Stupid animals! I'll put you down after I kill these weaklings.
No!
My hound!
How dare you!
Meat for the pack!
I let the dogs out!
I bleed...haha...but I won't die!
What? No, no! Stop! Obey your master!
Arrggghhhhh!
Ah-hah! Another chance to test my might.
On your guard!
Hah-HAH!
Tsk! You need more training.
Bested...by the likes of...
Everything must burn. None shall know of the Scarlet Crusade's shame!
You, too, shall be charred to ash!
Breath of the Dragon!
Purged by fire!
Burn, BURN!
Die in a fire!
My fire...has gone out.
Who crashing Ook party?
Me gonna Ook you in the dooker!
Get Ooking party started!
Come on and get your Ook on!
We gonna Ook all night!
In the dooker!
Ook! Oooook!!
Oh yeah!
Gonna spins around!
Urp... eats too many carrots...
You die!
You have... turnip... for a head...
Yes yes yes! So close! Just a pinch of...oops...
Too bitter! Just a drop of honey, and a cane of sugar, and maybe some corn? Yes, more corn!
Yes, yes, yes...no, no, no no no! Yes! No! Peppers!
Ahh! Help! What is that thing? It doesn't matter, nothing will stop me now, not when I'm so close! Maybe if I don't look at it...?
The waters whisper to me. Enemies approach.
You dare to disturb these waters? You will drown!
Spring to life!
Rise!
Living water, bring them death!
Behold the power of torrential waters!
Do not run, it only delays the inevitable.
Come in, the water's fine!
Let death wash over you.
As the waters foretold!
Your cause is hopeless!
The darkness clears...
I peer into these waters and my reflection is empty...
Waters... claim me...
You there, in the rafters! My sacred library has become possessed by the Sha!
See how they form every letter of these sacred scrolls; corrupting them, defiling them!
I beseech you kind strangers. Cleanse this place of their foul presence. Lay our stories to rest.
You must destroy the source of the corruption. Quickly, before our cherished history is erased forever!
Thank you, heroes. I...
Ah, it is not yet over. From what I see, we face the trial of the yaungol. Let me shed some light...As the tale goes, the yaungol was traveling across the Kun'lai plains when suddenly he was ambushed by two strange creatures! The yaungol attacked the beasts with great determination and ferocity. Yet, the more he attacked, the more fearsome the beasts grew! However, when he let it alone, the beast shrank to near nothingness. For you see, strife feeds on conflict. When you have peace in your heart, strife will find somewhere else to roam.
FOR THE ANCIENTS!
Oh, my. If I am not mistaken, it appears that the tale of Zao Sunseeker has come to life before us. According to the legend, long ago, there were five suns that burned brightly in the sky. When the winds blew, their intense heat caused great wildfires. Crops wilted, villages burned, and families wandered endlessly to seek refuge from the flames...
I can allow this no longer!
The fires, they are burning the library! Please, heroes! Purge this evil before the temple crumbles to ash!
The blistering heat must have dulled my senses... mirages! All of you!
Zao has become corrupted too! Please, fight him with dignity...
Zao was a true champion of our people, how sad it is to see his story tainted by the sha. I am relieved to see justice served to his memory.
You have my thanks, heroes. You have given peace to this sacred temple.
Now, off with you! I require meditation before I begin the restoration ritual.
Your forces are weak!
The heart of the Great Serpent will not fall into your hands!
Jade Serpent, grant me strength!
The cycle must continue, the Jade Serpent must be reborn!
The heart is MINE!
Leave this place!
The haze has been lifted from my eyes... forgive me for doubting you...
Die or surrender. You cannot defeat me.
Succumb to the darkness inside your soul.
See how effortlessly you become unraveled?
Abandon all hope.
Embrace your despair.
All is lost.
You cannot escape me. I am... in... every... breath...
Useless, all of you! Even the guards you've given me in tribute cannot keep these lesser beings from my palace!
Redeem - nay, prove yourselves now! Deal with these intruders! The clan who brings me their heads will have my favor!
These other clans aren't worthy of your time, great King!
Our clan holds true to the ways set forth by the ancients! We deserve the King's favor above all others!
Clan Harthak will show all why they are the truest of Mogu!
This is the might of Harthak!
Our clan is the true clan! No interloper can change that!
We are the greatest!
These other clans are nothing!
Clan Gurthan will show our King and the rest of you power hungry imposters why we are the rightful ones at his side!
The glory of Gurthan!
We will never surrender our right to rule the destiny of our people!
The Mogu cannot reclaim our rightful glory without our clan's strength!
These other clans are beneath you, my king! They sullied our great legacy of our people!
Clan Kargesh will demonstrate why only the strong deserve to stand at our King's side!
For Kargesh!
Impossible! Our might is the greatest in all the empire!
Who allowed these outsiders in our halls!? Only Clan Harthak or Clan Kargesh would stoop to such treachery! Only the dogs of Clan Gurthan would point fingers at others for their own failures! Your clan is the most desperate! It must have been you! Clan Gurthan is right! Only the honorless Clan Harthak could bring in a lesser race to do their bidding! You must be traitors! Silence, you motherless mu'shan herders! I'd blame your clan, but your skulls are too thick to figure out a child's puzzle box, let alone how to usurp power. A well-scripted exchange, but we are not fooled! Your clans are clearly in league with one another! For the glory of our King, our empire, we will put you all down! Clan Kargesh will not suffer these insults! We will have your heads to offer to the King as proof of our might soon enough!
Your mother is so old, she saw the rise of the first kingdom!
Your father is so weak that a Pandarian took pity on him and invited him to dinner!
Your clan is so low that Hozen tell stupid jokes about them!
Where did you get that weapon from? Your sister?
I hear something...
Stop them!
Slay them!
Search its corpse!
Such a waste...
What is this? More have come to claim my crown? They are small, weak!
You are not the first to challenge me, peons. You will not be the last!
Face the might of my arsenal, weaklings!
Fools! I possess the power of the elements!
MY MIGHT IS ENDLESS!
ENOUGH OF THIS FARCE! You will feel PAIN, cowards!
See how effortlessly I CRUSH your bones!
Fall to your knees, coward!
Hahaha! I am UNDEFEATED!
You call that...a fight...
Taran Zhu and the Shado-Pan are MINE. Come forward and die by my hand, as all who oppose me shall in the days to come!
Hatred will consume and conquer all!
Rage at your defeat.
Feed me your hatred!
No...NO!
The Sha of Hatred has fled my body... and the monastery, as well. I must thank you, strangers. The Shado-Pan are in your debt. Now, there is much work to be done...
I will not be caged again. These Shado-Pan could not stop me. Neither shall you!
Another violent death...
So long as violence lurks in your heart... I... will... return...
You! You have allowed the Sha to reawaken all these years
If you truly wish to undo what your kind have wrought upon our land you must first prove yourselves here in our school.
First, you will face our initiates...
Where one falls, another will rise to take its place.
You have much to learn if you wish to defend your people from the Sha initiate. Stand aside for your fellow students!
You have bested our most juniors of students. Now you will face two of my most senior.
Flying Snow! Fragrant Lotus! Step forward!
You have bested my prized students. Perhaps you can be of use to us after all...
As my master once said, "You cannot truly know someone until you fight them."
Come forward, so I that we may be properly introduced.
Very well then, outsider. Let us see your true strength.
Hold your back! For I will not.
Skill with a weapon is but a physical manifestation of one's martial strength. Let me show you what spiritual power is!
When I was but a cub I could scarcely throw a punch, but after years of training I can do so much more!
You need more training.
Your technique needs work.
I am bested. Give me a moment and we will venture together to face the Sha.
Weaklings...let me make room for our guests.
Approach...your death awaits.
Let me show you my power.
Come to me, serpent! Together we will destroy these intruders.
Serpent, charge me with your power!
Their energy is strong!
No, no! DO NOT FAIL ME!
Weakling!
Lightning has no mercy!
None may defy the Shado-pan!
Even together...we failed...
The gates are about to fall. Quickly! Slaughter these meddlers!
There will be no escaping me.
Hahahahaha!
This wall is your grave!
None may stand against us!
Empress...forgive me!
Gate!? I'm going to bring this whole wall down!
You're the bomb!
This will be the bomb.
I brought enough bombs... for all of you!
Things that make you go... BOOM!
BOOM! Explosion! Overpowering!
There goes the BOOM!
BOOM shakalaka!
I'm the bomber man...tid!
You blew it!
I... blew it...
Keep those archers off the wall. Raigonn must reach the gate.
I'll hurl your corpses from this tower.
You join a battle that is already lost!
Air superiority!
As expected!
Our numbers...endless! You cannot...win.
I hope they make it this far. Then my strength and skill will be clear to all.
Ah-hah! The lot of you will soon wish you hadn't come this way...
Allow me to show you the power of amber alchemy...
Your curve bones will decorate the weapons of our warriors!
Did you think you stood a chance?
But... I was... who will...!?
Swarmers, attack! Tear the flesh from their bones!
Demolishers, get in there! Leave nothing but a pile of ash!
Warriors, trample these weaklings! Crush them!
Carpet bomb the platform! Send in the Amberwing!
They are holding us off, bring in the air support!
Amberwing, get in there! Lay siege to their holdouts!
Where...where is it? Worthless, useless... damn you!
Everyone, send everything! Slaughter these cowards, they are making us look like fools!
Pah! Those who failed deserved to die; you merely culled the weak!
I must finish this myself, then. So be it!
Too easy!
Were you even trying?
Haha, you die so easily!
It was... a trap...
Niuzao's forces attack from the rear!
Flank! To the flank!
The prisoners are escaping!
The temple will fall! You cannot stop my forces!
My army will crush you!
Stop them! Mantid attack!
Put down your weapons or die!
The empress demands it!
The forces of Niuzao are weak!
I have failed you, empress...
You may have come this far. You may carved a path through my army, but I...will kill you, and I will build the bridge.
I will do what Pa'valak could not!
Out of my way!
Get back to work! I want this bridge finished by first light!
The...bridge...
My armies are endless, my power, unmatched.
I will crush you, in body AND spirit.
Flanking attack! March into battle!
Soldiers! Crush their flank!
My tactics are unbeatable.
Another victory.
The Emperor rules all!
I cannot be... defeated.
Bandits and emperors, we both take what we want.
You'll see your mistake soon enough!
All that is yours? Mine!
There is nothing I cannot take!
You were too slow!
I am too quick, too clever.
You stood no chance!
I am...bested.
I sense...courage. Willpower...light? That will not do.
Soon you will understand why my subjects fear the shadows!
The darkness comes for you, and with it, death.
Fall into darkness!
The shadows consume you!
This is what it means to face an emperor!
The darkness...surrounds me...
Who dares summon Emperor Meng, most majestic of mighty monarchs?
You have angered the emperor! THE SENTENCE IS DEATH!
Slaughter yourselves for my amusement!
Enemies... everywhere! Kill! Kill them all!
Like rice stalks before the blade, all fall before me.
None may stand against the Imperial majesty of Meng!
D-d-don't bleed on me! Filthy, disease!
You...you made me do it!
The sentence... was to be... yours!
I... I don't want to die...

The Emperor's Rage echoes through the hills.
The Emperor's Strength grips this land with fists of iron.
The Emperor's Courage burns everlasting.
The Endless Army will crush the Emperor's foes.
The Emperor's Breath abates.
The Emperor's Breath is regained.
The Emperor's Will dominates all it beholds.
Ah, yes...
Tender your souls, mortals. These are the halls of the dead!
Oh, Great Spirit! Grant me the power of the earth!
Oh, Exalted One! Through me you shall melt flesh from bone!
Oh, Sage of the Ages! Instill to me your arcane wisdom!
Great Soul of champions past, bear to me your shield!
They crumble so easily.
Ripe for the picking.
If they only knew... what horrors await...
Pitiful, wingless grubs. You step into my domain, and I will hear your death screams as you plummet from this terrace!
Set'thik, in formation! Show them who controls the winds of Pandaria!
Breath of the empress, bring mighty Garalon to us!
Garalon, grind their bones to dust!
Impossible! Set'thik, Zet'thik, Kor'thik, to the top of the terrace! We must defend the Empress!
Your defiance of the empress ends here!
All of Pandaria will fall beneath the Wings of the Empress!
My blade never misses its mark!
The skies belong to the Empress!
To die for the empress is an honor!
The wings of the empress cannot fail!
You will pay for your transgressions!
You fight like cowards!
Aid me brethren!
The Kor'thik have no equal in combat!
The mighty Zar'thik bend the wind to their will!
The Sra'thik command the elements of this land, leaving their foes imprisoned for all time!
The Empress commands it!
Pitiful.
Empress... I have... failed you...
Seal the gates! Bar the exits! Destroy these intruders!
Death to all who dare challenge my empire!
Sing... yes! Sing in agony!
Power... I must have more power! Guards! Protect your empress!
More... more! I must have more!
You must destroy these outsiders, empress! They have come to conquer your people!
I will dispose of the outsiders.
The mantid are under MY command, fools. See how she succumbs to me.
Yes, master.
You will serve ME now!
No more excuses, Empress! Eliminate these cretins or I will kill you myself!
Taste defeat, stranger!
Breathe no longer!
Such is the fate of those who question authority.
Augh... ah ... I... have failed.
USELESS! Fall limp and die before me, wretched insect. Your kind are worthless to me!
As for the rest of you, seek me if you dare. Like the others, you will all die screaming.
Ah, I see you have found a few of my experiments. Step closer, and you may witness the full glory of my work here.
You must be powerful, to have come this far. Yes, yes... you will make worthy test subjects.
Watch your step!
Feel fortunate to receive this gift.
From death comes life, and from life, death...
You must think yourself mighty. How little you know. Behold now, my greatest creation!
What have you done? No, this will not be how my work ends. I will not allow it!
Fa... ther....
Is that all?
Excellent!
Forgive me, Empress....
We are the extension of our Empress's will.
Ours is but to serve in Her divine name.
Never to question, nor to contemplate; we simply act.
We fight, toil, and serve so that Her vision for us is made reality.
Her happiness is our reward, her sorrow our failure.
We will give our lives for the Empress without hesitation. She is the light, and without Her our lives will be lost to darkness.
The chaff of the world tumbles across our doorstep, driven by fear; Her royal swarm will whisk them away.
They were clearly unworthy of Her divine embrace.
They are but the waves crashing upon the mountain of Her divine will. They may rise again and again; but will accomplish nothing.
We are unfazed. We will stand firm.
The Divine challenges us to face these intruders.
And so it falls to us, Her chosen voice.
The divine chose us to give mortal voice to Her divine will. We are but the vessel that enacts Her will.
Through the air we breathe. She strengthens our voice.
Behold the voice of Her divine wrath.
Her gifts are many, our gratitude immeasurable.
She tests us. We will not disappoint Her.
We are as unwavering as the amber that shapes our halls. With Her might we will vanquish all who dare intrude upon Her divine home.
Her will is greater than us all. You will join us or you will perish.
Our voice gives form to Her will.
The divine will not suffer your taint here, outsider!
Ours is but to serve, yours is but to die!
We will not give in to the despair of the dark void. If Her will for us is to perish, then it shall be so.
Now go, impart my techniques to the initiates.
Mere initiates.
They should have studied harder.
One technique alone is not enough.
They failed their test. Will you?
They approach? Good. Now, if only my students were here to see and learn from the coming display of martial prowess...
On your guard, invaders. I, Ta'yak, Lord of Blades, will be your opponent.
Can you follow my blade?
A perfect cut.
This is the technique of a Blade Lord.
I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday, to hear that sound. But to have it happen to my own prothorax is ridiculous.
Your lights will go out. The darkness will envelop you. And you will fear the shadows that move within it.
You will know fear!
Fleeeee!
The fear clouds my mind. I...cannot resist.
No one can stand against the fear. You will perish.
Its power is so strong. It forces me to destroy you.
Seek shelter, lest I strike you down as the Sha commands!
You face your fear. A moment's... peace.
Drown in terror.
You think it is so easy to vanquish your fears?
Dread rises! It seeks the light. It hungers.
Huddle in terror!
The terrace was not meant for your kind.
The endless waters will cleanse you from this place.
A storm approaches.
The tide cannot be stopped!
I command the elements, to destroy you!
My strength grows!
I command the elements, to destroy you!
The waters will consume you!
You cannot escape the storm!
None can match my strength!
Drown in your fear!
Drown in fear!
I will not be controlled!
Your fear will consume you!
You are unfit to stand before me!
Flee, child!
How dare you trespass here!
Shocking.
Weakling!
Begone!
The Sha...must be...stopped.
The Terrace... must not... fall...
We...are endless...
No... the waters... I must... resist... I shall not... fear...
You do not belong here! The waters must be protected... I will cast you out, or slay you!
Flee this place... or die!
Overwhelming... fear!
Darkness grows...
Day falls to night...
Light fades...
Night... becomes day!
The sun... shines through...
Once more... the dawn...
Die in darkness.
The night surrounds you...
No...!
Forgive me!
Protect... the waters...
I thank you, strangers. I have been freed.
Wh-what are you doing here!? G-go away!
I did not want to have to do this!
I'm hiding until you leave!
I don't want to see you anymore!
Stay away from me!
Get AWAY!
S-sorry!
It's your fault it happened!
I... ah... oh! Did I...? Was I...? It was... so... cloudy.
I have to go now.
I have to make the water not cloudy anymore. Will... will you help?
So cold, so dark...
We will not be forgotten, no, no, no...
We are the perfect one, yes, yes, not a failure, no, no, not a failure...
What is this? What do they want? To punish us? No, no...
Your flesh, yes yes, so perfect, GIVE IT TO US!
No, no, no! The pain returns!
It tears at us from the inside!
Who is perfect now? Yes, yes...
Again... we are torn apart... Again... to the cold darkness...
Turn back now, strangers. You face the army of Iron Qon!
Strike quickly, Manchu! Show them no mercy!
THEY ARE NO MATCH FOR MANCHU!
Focus, Weisheng! Show your enemy the meaning of pain!
Yes, master! I will fight with my life!
All brawn, no brains. A recoverable loss.
He fought with honor... his first and last mistake.
Enough of this! Come now, weaklings. You have earned your reward... you may now face the Iron Qon!
Stare into the face of true power!
Dam'ren! Freeze them to oblivion!
Quet'zal! Unleash the storm upon my enemies!
Ro'shak! Grant me wings of flame!
Gaaaahh!
How can this be?!
USELESS!
ARGH! Worthless mongrels! I will kill you myself!
I run you through!
Fall at my feet!
What a pathetic display.
More... training...
The Thunder King give me power! Come! I show you!
I must break you!
Zap!
Smash!
Crush your bones!
I call the storm!
Weak!
So easy to break!
Bored. You die now.
How... you... beat me?
Welcome, weaklings, to the rebirth of the Zandalari Empire!
The tribes have assembled - ye face not one force, but the combined might of all of the troll empire! The hand of Zul will span all the continents of Azeroth once again! An ye lesser races will know pain!
Now, witness the true might of the Beast Ward. D'akala di'chuka HORRIDON! Kalimaste!
Farraki tribe, flay their flesh wit the fury of the sands!
Gurubashi tribe, send their bloated corpses down the river with ya jungle poisons.
Drakkari tribe, show them the might of the frozen North!
Amani tribe, avenge ye fallen warlords, in the name of Zul'jin!
Hahaha! Now it be my turn! Ye gonna see what it means to be a War-God!
Ya skull gonna make a fine ornament for my tusks.
Da'kala koraste...Horridon...destroy them...
Stop them! The Animus must not be disturbed!
The power... It cannot be wielded this way! You tempt forces you do not understand!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
You have doomed yourselves. It... is... unleashed.
You! You have earned my ire. I will make an example of you, such that all who look upon my might will tremble and submit.
I am Lei Shen, slayer of kings and gods. You have made a grave mistake.
Kneel!
Die!
Submit!
Lightning, seek my foes!
Wind, heed my call!
My power cannot be contained!
You have sealed your doom!
You would challenge me in my own sanctum? Witness your folly!
Bah! I will crush you myself. Let us see how you fare against Lightning.
You are NOTHING! I wield the power of the heavens!
NO! You are UNWORTHY! I... AM... THE THUNDER KING!
Enough of this!
Minuscule.
Unworthy.
My judgement is final.
Lightning strikes.
Kneel before me!
I sought only to finish... the work of the Gods...
Intruders! Guardians of the throne, awaken!
So lonely...
Ah ah ah...
More kindling for the flame. Come, Lulin, let us burn them to ash.
If I must...
Please, just go! You are making her angry.
Just leave me alone!
You do not belong here!
Witness the true meaning of pain!
BLAZE OF DEATH!
Lulin! Lend me your strength!
Just this once...
You shouldn't have come here.
Die in agony.
Was that really necessary?
Hahahahahaha!
I can see the light.
Are they gone yet?
It is warm...
Now I'm really angry!
Strike at these barbarians with the full force of my rage!
You do not fight alone! Unleash my storm upon these invaders!
It is not much, but I will lend you what little I have. May it help you in this final hour.
I lend you the cold vengeance of the northern winds!
Witness the powa of the Spiritbinder!
Death ta all who appose da empire!
Da spiritbinder reveals yer soul ta me!
Yer soul belongs ta me!
Succumb ta her venom!
Embrace yer demise!
Shadra's rage will destroy you!
She will feast on yer soul!
Another offering to da loa!
Shadra... save... me...
Dis is gonna hurt!
Ya shouldn't be messin' wit da Zandalari!
Incoming!
Out da way!
Shocking!
Da Amani empire cannot be stopped!
On ya knees!
Da thunder king... promised...
Ya have met your match, fools!
Winter is coming...
Freeze!
Getting cold?
Da' Drakkari will never fall to de' likes of you!
Death's cold embrace.
Witness da Drakkari's might.
Da... empire... can't... fall...
Da sands will consume everyting!
I will bury ya all!
Da storm approaches!
Watch yer step!
Dey tink dey can stop da Farraki?
Da sands are endless.
Da first of many!
I return... to... da... sands...
For millennia I have waited in darkness, in silence pierced only by the shrieks of the tormented, my dreams a waking nightmare.
I see the naive hope in your eyes... You think you are my saviors? Wring that mocking pity from your hearts and focus it inwards, for you shall soon know my agony.
This twisted world is beyond redemption... beyond the reach of deluded heroes... The only answer to corruption... is destruction. And that begins now.
When I am finished with you, I shall not rest until this world is cleansed. Now, perish!
Feel your own life essence betray you!
The touch of creation... and destruction.
Ah, the familiar embrace of the storms...
This is but a taste of my power.
You still think victory possible? Ha! Fools!
Accept the inevitable.
Amusing. You really thought you could win.
You are the best this world has to offer? No wonder it has fallen to ruin.
Wait! I am... I am not your enemy. You are powerful, more powerful than he was, even... perhaps you are right. Perhaps there is still hope. But there is a yawning chasm of darkness beneath you mortals, vast, endless, and all consuming. I do not believe that you can correct this doomed course. But you have earned the right to try. Farewell.
Thousands of years ... without new playthings ... I will enjoy this.
Behold the power of the void.
Observe your demise.
The mists hide many secrets... if you know where to look.
I'm keeping an eye on you.
Watch your footing...muhahaha!
I expected so much more. How... disappointing.
Do you see what I did there?
Looks like you couldn't keep up ... pity.
I... welcome... the void's... embrace.
Don't be foolish, Vol'jin! You have no siege weapons left! You cannot win this battle.
You may have defeated my war machine, but the gate still stands. You will not take Orgrimmar today.
What!? Kor'kron, to the gates, now!
Oh, look. You're the ones who smashed up my Juggernaut.
Let's see how you like the newest addition to the Warchief's arsenal... the Iron Star!
Aggron! Show 'em who's boss!
Goro'dan! You're on deck!
All right, Shanna. You're up.
Looks like I'm in the market for a new assistant.
Let's settle this.
Time to mix business with pleasure.
Start the assembly line!
Another round!
More, MORE!!
The SD-5 Automated Shredder defense unit. A labor of love.
Presenting... the beautiful new ST-03 Shockwave missile turret!
Meet the LT-403 Evaporation laser. A personal point of pride.
Ya' ever wonder how magnets work?
What's better than a bomb, huh?! I'll tell ya - a bomb with two bombs inside!
Hey, I heard you like mines, so... enjoy!
Hey! You're gonna pay for that!
You son of a...
Another satisfied customer.
That's for the Juggernaut.
Don't... think you've won...
My legacy... will live on...
Storm! Earth! And fire! Bend to our will!
We do not ask the elements for aid... The True Horde takes what it wants!
Crumbling earth, plagued with rust!
Tortured wind, stale and toxic!
Anguished water, stagnant and poisonous!
Long-dead fire, black and smouldering!
The blood of the True Horde lusts for power!
Your skull will adorn my necklace.
My wolf will feast on your blood!
The elements... what have we done...
I can hear them no longer...
Halt!
No further corruption will enter the heart chamber!
You wish to purge the corruption?
Should you pass this door, at this time, you would fail! You, all of you, are corrupted with the insidious plague known as Pride.
You stand tall and proud atop your accomplishments, and this will be your downfall.
Should you wish to defeat the corruption, you will first need to purify the corruption within yourselves.
Speak to me again when you are prepared to face your inner demons.
Very well, I will create a field to keep your corruption quarantined.
Prove yourselves worthy and I will let you pass.
The light cleanses; but it is not gentle. Gird yourselves and be purified!
Be purified in the light!
Face your inner demons!
Look inside yourself and cleanse the darkness within.
Stand in the light and be judged!
Unworthy.
Only the pure of heart may pass!
The light will not suffer your taint.
You have been judged, and proven yourselves worthy. But be warned, what lies beyond will try your souls to their utmost. When you are fully prepared, you may enter the chamber.
You... Rook knows you...
Rook... does not know... Head... is cloudy...
We know only despair now. A fitting punishment for our failure...
Please... help...
Sun... He... aid me.
Will you succeed where we have failed?
Brawl... with Rook.
Rook fight!
We must redeem the Vale!
You will suffer from our failure.
Rook... needs help!
Protectors, come to my aid!
You... are not my friend.
You too have failed.
We will never find solace.
Rook... not safe...
We have not fulfilled our oath!
Feeling... better now... Thank you... little friend.
We return to when we lost our way. You... are very kind.
Hey, we recording? Yeah? Ok. Goblin titan control module starting up! Please stand back!
Checking out the data -- hold on a second will ya?
Oh... now you've did it! That was really really really not the correct imput code!

Have a great day and don't let the door hit you on the way out.
Look, brothers! The Wakener is here!
They made it this far? I told you the others needed some microsonic genetic alterations!
How illogical, did they not take your warning Kil'ruk?
We Mantid serve a power far greater than they or their gods.
It matters not. The Old One will not suffer their intrusion.
We have endured the Usurpers, their children, the loss of the Old One, and soon... you.
We will slay you all as easily as we slew the pandaren of old!
And then the Old One will remake this world for the Mantid!
Come, children of the Titans, you face the Paragons.
Time for a little target practice.
Another kill, another trophy!
Yes... A target of great importance.
My intelligence suggests this one is a high-value target.
Target practice has ended.
The hunter... becomes... the hunted...
Yes... new test subjects!
Curses! More data lost to an untimely death!
Success! They are alive!
Natural evolution takes far too long. Here, let me help you along...
Hmmm, Dead already?! I wonder if a session of micro-sonic deep-gene probing can reanimate them...
Perhaps I could have used... some enhancements... of my own...
I will drink your blood!
Another notch for my blade.
Feast on the blood of our enemies!
Look how they fall, like so many blades of grass in the wind.
Avenge me, brothers!
You move too slowly, how does your kind catch any prey?
See Kil'ruk? Speed is king!
I ache with power!
Muahahahahaha!
Zooooooooom!
Much too slow.
Curse this shell, I was not fast enough!
You now face the Prime. Bow down to your superior!
The Usurpers have abandoned you.
The amber protects us.
The Old One grants us strength.
We remain unscathed.
Return me to the amber...
Chaos is order unrecognized by a lesser mind!
I predicted that to be a likely outcome.
How about a game?
An interesting commonality, now to exploit it!
I see many threes repeating...
So easily solved, you're not so complicated after all!
My calculations, incorrect? Perhaps another 800 years...
Have you come to try my new concoctions, Wakener? I assure you, these are nothing like you've tasted before.
My alchemy is supreme!
So many wonderful varieties, which concoction shall I give you?
All reactions begin with the proper catalyst.
There is nothing the proper mixture can't handle.
I never discovered... how to put a stopper... in death...
Come little Kunchongs, it's feeding time!
A fitting meal for my children.
Your mind has grown weak since we last met.
Zor'lok wasn't the only one with a strong voice!
Let the feast begin!
Kovok... Come to me... I need...
I will carry you one last time, Wakener... to your doom.
Watch how I soar!
I am a leaf on the wind!
Better drop!
I did warn you, Wakener.
Well fought Wakener. We will meet again...
The corruption is amplifying. The fragments must be purged before it becomes too great.
It did not matter. It comes. Steel your hearts and prepare your souls.
Come, face me. Give in to your pride. Show me your "Greatness".
So foolish...
You are better than your companions!
Your arrogance compels you...
Your arrogance feeds me!
Succumb to your pride!
You should bow to no king or warchief.
Be humble.
Free yourself of arrogance.
You've let your pride cloud your vision, Titan puppet! You can never contain ME!
You... must... contain... it...
That one is WEAK.
That one is unworthy of your group.
Blame your companions!
Ha! Do you remember nothing of honor? Of glory on the battlefield? You would parlay with the humans, who have warlocks practice their dark magic right under our feet. You are weak.
We are the Orcish Horde, the True Horde. We die bloody and thrashing on the field of battle, like true orcs SHOULD.
You are an orc no longer, and speak for none but yourself. You betrayed our people to forge your fragile alliances and I will take great pleasure in tearing them apart.
Fool. My dark shaman have twisted and tortured the elements for miles around. They cannot hear you now. Once again you proved too weak and powerless to do anything.
So, you wish to face off against a real Orc Warchief. So be it.
I, Garrosh, Son of Grom, will show you what it means to be called Hellscream!
My people should have taken this world long ago, during the First War! But they fell to corruption in their weakness. They asked the pitiful races of Azeroth to join the Horde. I will succeed where they have failed, and no power in this world can stop me!
Witness the power of the true Horde's arsenal.
We will cleanse this world in steel and fire.
Warbringers, bloody your blades. Lok'tar Ogar!
Farseers, mend our wounds!
For the True Horde!
Die with honor!
Blood and thunder!
Anger. hatred. fear!! They are weapons of war - the tools of a Warchief!
Yes... yes. I can see it now...I can see the future of this world...A world ruled by the Horde...MY Horde.
The old one calls to you.
The Heart will be your end!
See the visions of fear, despair and doubt as I have.
You will be trapped for eternity!
You can never leave this place. There is no way home.
You will die when you leave this place. There is nothing left of your world.
You have already lost.
All of your friends are dead.
No one is coming to save you.
Your allies will leave you behind.
You cannot succeed. Your cause is hopeless.
Your allies think you are weak.
You do not have the strength to defeat him, you are too weak to carry on.
The power flows through me!
The power to crush your world, and everything on it!
All will fall in the name of Hellscream!
The True Horde WILL come to pass. I have SEEN it. IT HAS SHOWN ME. I HAVE SEEN MOUNTAINS OF SKULLS AND RIVERS OF BLOOD. AND I WILL... HAVE... MY... WORLD!
You think you have WON? You are BLIND. I WILL FORCE YOUR EYES OPEN
BEHOLD, MY GLORIOUS DESTINY!
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN MY WORLD.
I WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVER LOVED.
Pitiful.
Weak.
Now you know your place in my new world.
No... It cannot end...like this...What I... What I have seen...
No... NO... This world... is my destiny... My, destiny.
Nazgrim has failed us. Kor'kron, destroy these intruders!
I will never fail the Warchief!
Weaklings!
You dare challenge the Warchief?
Garrosh gives me strength!
Witness the might of the True Horde!
The power of the Warchief will overwhelm you!
The True Horde cannot be STOPPED!
Stand and FACE ME!
The overwhelming power!
The Warchief demands it!
To die... for the warchief... is... an... honor...
Dragonmaw clan, retake the docks and push them into the sea! In the name of Hellscream and the True Horde!
Next squad, push forward!
Dragonmaw, advance!
For Hellscream!
For the True Horde!
They breached a tower, bring it down!
Turn their siege weapons to attack that tower and bury them alive!
You dare try to take my tower? Hahaha...
I am Dragonmaw, I am the blood of the Dragon and the fist of the Horde!
You... cannot win... this war...
Light the fuses! They will not leave this tower alive!
Is that all you got?
At least... I die... with honor...
Ahhhhhhh!
No Alliance hand has ever struck me down! Do you think you are seasoned enough?
So, it has come to this. Together, we have learned and grown over the years, and now we find ourselves face to face on the battlefield. Do not think I will go easy on you, nor do I expect any quarter. What we do now, we do for the Horde, both of us.
I am Nazgrim! Fist of the warchief and general of the Horde army. If I must die today, I will die with honor, in battle, for the horde!
It is an honor to finally face you in combat. Lok'tar Ogar, for Honor, and for the Horde!
Kor'kron, at my side!
Warriors, on the double!
Next squad, to the front!
Defend the gate!
Rally the forces!
All Kor'kron... under my command... kill them... NOW!
You should have trained harder.
I die... with honor... Lok'tar Ogar...
Ah... you have learned much... and learned well... an honorable battle.
In the end, I stood by the warchief, because it was my duty, and I am glad that it was you who struck me down. May your strength... lead the horde... into a new era of prosperity...
Gamon, you have finally learned. I am proud to have died at your hands.
For the Horde.
t's busting out of the cage! Arm the shock collar, get that thing under control!
Shock it until it can't move anymore! It's causing a riot in here!
Deal with the devilsaur first, then we'll lock the rest up!
What's going on in here? Get that thing back in its cage!
Intruders! I will lock you in a cell with the rest of the filth.
Stop this madness! You have no idea what you're dealing with!
Stop, my brothers! Do you not see the beast of burden before you?
Do you not see the light of Kros? He has been defiled!
We must consume his flesh, for he is weak! The cycle must continue!
Burn them all! Burn them to ash!
Thank you, friends. I will lend what aid I can.
Azeroth has cowered too long under our shadow! Now, feel the power of the Burning Crusade, and despair!
Your fate is sealed, Azeroth! I will find the Aspect Shards, and then you will not stand against our might!
Cower, little worms! Your heroes are nothing! Your saviors will be our first feast!
Where? Where are the Shards! You cannot hide them from us!
Your world will die, mortals! Your doom is now at hand!
Your own strength feeds me!
Ha! This place is not yet worthy of my infliction.
I remember well the sting of defeat at the conclusion of the Third War. I have waited far too long for my revenge. Now the shadow of the Legion falls over this world. It is only a matter of time until all of your failed creation... is undone.
All mortals will perish!
The Legion will conquer all!
Kirel Narak!
Contemptible wretch!
All life must be eradicated!
I'll rip the flesh from your bones!
The universe will be remade.
The Legion... will never... fall.
Invaders, you dangle upon the precipice of oblivion! The Burning Legion comes and with it comes your end. 
Impudent whelps, you only delay the inevitable. Where one has fallen, ten shall rise. Such is the will of Kazzak...
Hope is a DISEASE of the soul! This land shall wither and die!
Taste your world's corruption!
Loot and pillage, bwahahaha!
Bring me their corpses!
Arm the cannons! Ready! Aim! FIRE!
They are soft, weak!
Retreat to the hills!
I can sense the SHADOW on your hearts. There can be no rest for the wicked!
Your wicked souls shall feed my power!
Peace is but a fleeting dream! Let the NIGHTMARE reign!
Children of Madness - I release you upon this world!
How dare you interupt our preparations! The Zandalari will not be stopped! Not this time!
Destroy them! I command you! No, stop, STOP!
My pain... is endless...
The flames... never cease...
I burn... for all time...
You will take my place on the eternal brazier.
Your flesh will melt.
You will feel but a fraction of my agony.
Burn!
Your pain will be endless.
Up in smoke.
The eternal fire will never be extinguished.
I am born of thunder!
Can you feel a chill wind blow? The storm is coming...
The clouds arc with vengeance!
The air crackles with anger!
The sky weeps for your demise!
I am but...the darkness...before the storm...
Give in to your anger.
Your rage gives you strength!
Your rage sustains me!
You will not bury me again!
My wrath flows freely!
Yes, YES! Bring your rage to bear! Try to strike me down!
Feed me with your ANGER!
My fury is UNLEASHED!
Extinguished!
Does that make you angry?
Feel your rage!
Let your rage consume you.
Do not proceed. You will be eliminated.
Tectonic disruption commencing.
Magnitude set. Release.
Trajectory locked.
Engage maximum speed.
Target exterminated.
Directive accomplished.
System failure in five, f-o-u-r...
Threat level zero.
Begone, uncouth scum! The Alliance shall prevail in Alterac Valley!
Filthy Frostwolf cowards! If you want a fight, you'll have to come to me!
I'm coming, Frostwolf! And this time you're gonna feel the flames!
Senior Wing Commander Vipore launching. Pray for a swift death, Frostwolf.
Drek'Thar, I'm coming for you!
Soldiers of Stormpike, aid and protect us! The Forest Lord has granted us his protection. The portal must now be opened!
Wicked, wicked, mortals! The forest weeps. The elements recoil at the destruction. Ivus must purge you from this world!
I come to raze your bases, Frostwolf Clan. Ivus punishes you for your treachery!
Soldiers of Stormpike, your General is under attack! I require aid! Come! Come! Slay these mangy Frostwolf dogs.
You'll never get me out of me bunker, heathens!
Die! Your kind has no place in Alterac Valley!
I'll never fall for that, fool! If you want a battle, it will be on my terms and in my lair.
Guse is entering the battle! Time to take out the Stormpike filth!
Jeztor's coming for you, Stormpike!
Incoming air support to Dun Baldar! Stormpike bow down!
Soldiers of Frostwolf, aid and protect us! The Ice Lord has granted us his protection. The portal must now be opened!
It is done! The Ice Lord has arrived! Bow to the might of the Horde, fools!
WHO DARES SUMMON LOKHOLAR? The blood of a thousand Stormpike soldiers shall I spill... none may stand against the Ice Lord!
I drink in your suffering, mortal. Let your essence congeal with Lok'holar!
Your base is forfeit, puny mortals!
Stormpike filth!? In my keep! Slay them all!
You seek to draw the General of the Frostwolf legion out from his fortress? PREPOSTEROUS!
